Gradient Boosting-based Summarization:
The code starts by setting up the necessary imports and environment variables, including the OpenAI API key.
It then defines a speech text and creates a series of chat messages (SystemMessage, HumanMessage) to be used with the ChatOpenAI model for summarization.
The code calls the get_num_tokens method to count the number of tokens in the speech text and then generates a summary using the ChatOpenAI model.
Prompt Templates for Text Summarization:
This section demonstrates the use of a PromptTemplate to create a customizable prompt for text summarization.
The generic_template variable defines a template that takes the speech text and the desired language as input and generates a summary.
The LLMChain is then used to apply the prompt and generate a summary in the specified language.
StuffDocumentChain for Text Summarization:
This part of the code reads a PDF document using the PyPDF2 library and extracts the text content.
The text is then wrapped in a Document object and passed to the load_summarize_chain function, which uses the StuffDocumentChain to generate a summary.
Summarizing Large Documents Using Map Reduce:
This section demonstrates the use of the map_reduce chain type from LangChain to summarize a large document.
The code splits the text into smaller chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and then applies the map_reduce chain to generate a summary.
Map Reduce With Custom Prompts:
This part of the code showcases the ability to use custom prompts for the map_reduce chain.
It defines a chunk_prompt and a final_combine_prompt to customize the summarization process.
The summary_chain is then created using the custom prompts and applied to the text chunks.
RefineChain for Summarization:
The final section demonstrates the use of the refine chain type, which iteratively refines the summary of the text.

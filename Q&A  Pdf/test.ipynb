       " Document(page_content='Having two dads offered me the choice of  \\ncontrasting points of view:  \\none of a rich man and one of a poor man.  Introduction\\nRICH DAD POOR DAD1\\nI had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly \\neducated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years \\nof undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to \\nStanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern \\nUniversity to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. \\nThe other father never finished the eighth grade.\\nBoth men were successful in their careers, working hard all their \\nlives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled \\nfinancially. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. \\nOne died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and \\nhis church. The other left bills to be paid.\\nBoth men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men \\noffered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men \\nbelieved strongly in education but did not recommend the same course \\nof study.\\nIf I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his \\nadvice. Having two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points \\nof view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man.\\nInstead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found \\nmyself thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself. The \\nproblem was that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Introduction2\\nwas not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and \\nboth were struggling with money and families. But they had very \\ndifferent points of view about money.\\nFor example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root \\nof all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”\\nAs a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me \\nwas difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers \\ndid not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, \\nparticularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and \\nintrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about \\nwhat each was saying.\\nMuch of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself \\nquestions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same \\nquestion of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much \\neasier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply \\nreject the point of view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what \\nhe’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced \\nme to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a \\nprocess, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in \\nthe long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.\\nOne of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and \\nthe middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is \\ntaught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from \\nour parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? \\nThey simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may \\ngraduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person’s financial \\nprogramming and mindset.\\nSadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic \\nand professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how \\nsmart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades \\nmay struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt \\nis due in large part to highly educated politicians and government \\nofficials making financial decisions with little or no training in the  \\nsubject of money.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad3\\nToday I often wonder what will soon happen when we have \\nmillions of people who need financial and medical assistance. They \\nwill be dependent upon their families or the government for financial \\nsupport. What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run  \\nout of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about \\nmoney continues to be left to parents—most of whom will be, or \\nalready are, poor?\\nBecause I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of \\nthem. I had to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I \\ngained valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on \\none’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford \\nit.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask,  \\n“How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. \\nOne lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My  \\nsoon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the \\nwords “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the \\nquestion “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He did  \\nnot mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical \\nabout exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the  \\nworld. He’d say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise  \\nit. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that \\nautomatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.\\nAlthough both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a \\nhabit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the \\nother had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was \\nthat one dad grew stronger financially, and the other grew weaker. It \\nis not much different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise \\non a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching \\ntelevision. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, \\nand proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. \\nMy two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way \\nthey thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in \\ntaxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes \\npunish those who produce and reward those who don’t produce.” ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Introduction4\\nOne dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good \\ncompany to work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you \\ncan find a good company to buy.”\\nOne dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you \\nkids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have  \\nyou kids.”\\nOne encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner \\ntable, while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed \\nover a meal.\\nOne said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take \\nrisks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.”\\nOne believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our  \\ngreatest asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your \\nhouse is your largest investment, you’re in trouble.”\\nBoth dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while \\nthe other paid his bills last.\\nOne dad believed in a company or the government taking care \\nof you and your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises, \\nretirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and \\nother perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the \\nmilitary and earned a retirement-and-entitlement package for life  \\nafter twenty years of active service. He loved the idea of medical \\nbenefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also \\nloved the tenure system available through the university. The idea  \\nof job protection for life and job benefits seemed more important, \\nat times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve worked hard for the \\ngovernment, and I’m entitled to these benefits.”\\nThe other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out \\nagainst the entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially \\nneedy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.\\nOne dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created \\ninvestments. One dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé \\nso I could find a good job. The other taught me how to write strong \\nbusiness and financial plans so I could create jobs.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad5\\nBeing a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of \\nobserving the effects different thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed \\nthat people really do shape their lives through their thoughts.\\nFor example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And \\nthat prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always \\nreferred to himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, \\nand rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a \\nmajor financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. \\nHe would cover himself by saying, “There is a difference between \\nbeing poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.”\\nMy poor dad would say, “I’m not interested in money,” or  \\n“Money doesn’t matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.”\\nThe power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, \\nbut it became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important \\nto be aware of my thoughts and how \\nI expressed myself. I noticed that my \\npoor dad was poor, not because of the \\namount of money he earned, which was \\nsignificant, but because of his thoughts \\nand actions. As a young boy having two \\nfathers, I became acutely aware of being \\ncareful about which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. Should I \\nlisten to my rich dad or to my poor dad?\\nAlthough both men had tremendous respect for education and \\nlearning, they disagreed about what they thought was important to \\nlearn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job \\nto earn money. He wanted me to study to become a professional, an \\nattorney or an accountant, and to go to business school for my MBA. \\nThe other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how \\nmoney works, and to learn how to have it work for me. “I don’t work \\nfor money!” were words he would repeat over and over. “Money works \\nfor me!”\\nAt the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich \\ndad about money. In doing so, I chose not to listen to my poor dad,  \\neven though he was the one with all the college degrees.There is a difference \\nbetween being poor  \\nand being broke.  \\nBroke is temporary.  \\nPoor is eternal.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad7\\nAnd that has made all the difference.\\nOver the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost’s poem. \\nChoosing not to listen to my highly educated dad’s advice and attitude \\nabout money was a painful decision, but it was a decision that shaped \\nthe rest of my life.\\nOnce I made up my mind about whom to listen to, my education \\nabout money began. My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years \\nuntil I was 39 years old. He stopped once he realized that I knew and fully \\nunderstood what he had been trying to drum into my often-thick skull.\\nMoney is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial \\neducation. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about \\nhow money works, you gain power over it and can begin building \\nwealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because \\nmost people went to school and never learned how money works, so \\nthey spend their lives working for money.\\nBecause I was only nine years old when I started, the lessons my rich \\ndad taught me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there \\nwere only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is about \\nthose six lessons, put as simply as possible, just as simply as my rich dad \\nput forth those lessons to me. The lessons are meant not to be answers, \\nbut guideposts that will assist you and your children to grow wealthier \\nno matter what happens in a world of increasing change and uncertainty.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

After grade six, these kids and I would go on to the public \\nintermediate and high school. There was no private school for them \\nor for me.\\nMy dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.\\n“Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have \\nto learn to make money.”\\n“How do I make money?” I asked.\\n“Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew \\nthat really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know \\nthe answer, so don’t embarrass me.”\\n \\nA Partnership Is Formed\\nThe next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had \\nsaid. As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this \\nschool. Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had \\ndrawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in  \\nschool with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we  \\nwere because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, \\nnew everything.\\nMom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter,  \\nand clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want \\nsomething, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much \\nwork available for nine-year-old boys.\\n“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.\\n“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”\\nHe agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my \\nfirst business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas \\non how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool \\nguys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt \\nwas good, because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make \\nmoney. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an \\nidea Mike got from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook \\nhands, and the partnership now had a business.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a \\nsmile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t \\ntell you. It’s a business secret.”\\nMy mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a \\nsite next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our \\nraw materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup \\nbottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.\\nFinally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’ \\nmessy, crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you \\nboys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business \\nsecret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”\\nMike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon \\nhave enough and then we would begin production. We informed her \\nthat we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste \\nso we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.\\nThe date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was \\non. My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction \\nnotice by my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to \\nquickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to \\nbrush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.\\nOne day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old \\nboys in the driveway with a production line operating at full speed. \\nThere was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table were small \\nmilk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing \\nwith red-hot coals at maximum heat.\\nDad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of \\nthe driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and \\nhis friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in \\nwhich the toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days, \\ntoothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of \\nlead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the \\nsmall steel pot. They melted until they became liquid, and with my ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

White powder \\nwas everywhere. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the \\nentire area looked like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk \\ncartons were the outer containers for plaster of paris molds.\\nMy dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten \\nlead through a small hole in the top of the plaster of paris cube.\\n“Careful,” my dad said.\\nI nodded without looking up.\\nFinally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down \\nand smiled at my dad.\\n“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile.\\n“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,”  \\nI said.\\n“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.”\\n“And what is in those plaster molds?” my dad asked.\\n“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.”\\nWith a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube \\nin half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a \\nlead nickel fell out.\\n“Oh, no!” my dad exclaimed. “You’re casting nickels out of lead!”\\n“That’s right,” Mike said. “We’re doing as you told us to do. We’re  \\nmaking money.”\\nMy dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled \\nand shook his head. Along with a fire and a box of spent toothpaste \\ntubes, in front of him were two little boys covered with white dust \\nsmiling from ear to ear.\\nHe asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front  \\nstep of our house. With a smile, he gently explained what the word \\n“counterfeiting” meant.\\nOur dreams were dashed. “You mean this is illegal?” asked Mike \\nin a quivering voice.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",

Keep going. I’m really proud  \\nof you!”\\nDisappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes \\nbefore we began cleaning up our mess. The business was over on \\nopening day. Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike and said,  \\n“I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. We are poor.”\\nMy father was just leaving as I said that. “Boys,” he said. “You’re \\nonly poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did \\nsomething. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You’ve \\ndone something. I’m very proud of the two of you. I will say it again: \\nKeep going. Don’t quit.”\\nMike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we  \\nstill did not know what to do.\\n“So how come you’re not rich, Dad?” I asked.\\n“Because I chose to be a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers really don’t \\nthink about being rich. We just like to teach. I wish I could help you, \\nbut I really don’t know how to make money.”\\nMike and I turned and continued our cleanup.\\n“I know,” said my dad. “If you boys want to learn how to be  \\nrich, don’t ask me. Talk to your dad, Mike.”\\n“My dad?” asked Mike with a scrunched-up face.\\n“Yeah, your dad,” repeated my dad with a smile. “Your dad  \\nand I have the same banker, and he raves about your father. He’s  \\ntold me several times that your father is brilliant when it comes to  \\nmaking money.”\\n“My dad?” Mike asked again in disbelief. “Then how come we \\ndon’t have a nice car and a nice house like the rich kids at school?”\\n“A nice car and a nice house don’t necessarily mean you’re rich or \\nyou know how to make money,” my dad replied. “Jimmy’s dad works for ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

He seems to be building \\nan empire, and I suspect in a few years he will be a very rich man.”\\nWith that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began \\ncleaning up the mess caused by our now-defunct first business. As we \\nwere cleaning, we made plans for how and when to talk to Mike’s dad. \\nThe problem was that Mike’s dad worked long hours and often did not \\ncome home until late. His father owned warehouses, a construction \\ncompany, a chain of stores, and three restaurants. It was the restaurants \\nthat kept him out late.\\nMike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up.

He wore khaki slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but \\nwithout starch, and polished work boots. He was about 10 years older \\nthan my dad. They smiled as Mike and I walked past them toward the \\nback porch. I smiled back shyly.\\n“Who are those people?” I asked.\\n“Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses, \\nand the women are the managers of the restaurants. And as you \\narrived, you saw the construction supervisor who is working on a \\nroad project about 50 miles from here. His other supervisor, who is \\nbuilding a track of houses, left before you got here.”\\n“Does this go on all the time?” I asked.\\n“Not always, but quite often,” said Mike, smiling as he pulled up \\na chair to sit down next to me.\\n“I asked my dad if he would teach us to make money,” Mike said.\\n“Oh, and what did he say to that?” I asked with cautious curiosity.\\n“Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he \\nwould make us an offer.”\\n“Oh,” I said, rocking my chair back against the wall.

On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the \\nroad and parking lot. Every time a car drove by or pulled into the \\nparking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store.

Fear does.”\\n“So is that why they’ll take jobs with low pay?” I asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people because  \\nI don’t pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government.

I want to expand your point of view so you can see \\nsomething most people never have the benefit of seeing because their \\nvision is too narrow. Most people never see the trap they are in.”\\nMike and I sat there, uncertain of his message. He sounded cruel, \\nyet we could sense he was trying to drive home a point.\\nWith a smile, rich dad said, “Doesn’t that 25 cents an hour sound \\ngood?

He understood that every \\nperson has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought, \\nand he knew that every individual also had a part of their soul that \\nwas resilient and could never be bought. It was only a question of \\nwhich one was stronger. \\n“Okay, five dollars an hour.”\\nSuddenly I was silent. Something had changed. The offer was too \\nbig and ridiculous. Not many grown-ups in 1956 made more than \\nthat, but quickly my temptation disappeared, and calm set in. Slowly, \\nI turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part \\nof my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that \\nhad no price took over. I knew Mike \\nhad gotten to that point too.\\n“Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most \\npeople have a price. And they have a \\nprice because of human emotions named \\nfear and greed. First, the fear of being \\nwithout money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that \\npaycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful \\nthings money can buy. The pattern is then set.”\\n“What pattern?” I asked.\\n“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work, \\npay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear \\nand greed. Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by \\nincreasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.” \\n“There is another way?” Mike asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad slowly. “But only a few people find it.” \\n“And what is that way?” Mike asked.\\n“That’s what I hope you boys will learn as you work and study  \\nwith me. That is why I took away all forms of pay.”\\n“Any hints?” Mike asked. “We’re kind of tired of working hard, \\nespecially for nothing.”\\n“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad.\\n“We haven’t been lying,” I said.People’s lives are  \\nforever controlled  \\nby two emotions:  \\nfear and greed.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",

Just admit it to yourself.”\\n“You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you, \\nMrs. Martin, they don’t do that?” I asked.\\n“I doubt it,” said rich dad. “Instead, they feel the fear of not \\nhaving money. They don’t confront it logically. They react emotionally \\ninstead of using their heads,” rich dad said. “Then, they get a few \\nbucks in their hands and again, the emotions of joy, desire, and greed \\ntake over. And again they react, instead of think.”\\n“So their emotions control their brain,” Mike said.\\n“That’s correct,” said rich dad. “Instead of admitting the truth \\nabout how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think. \\nThey feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe \\nthe fear, but it doesn’t. It continues to haunt them and they return \\nto work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it \\ndoesn’t. Fear keeps them in this trap of working, earning money,  \\nworking, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day \\nthey get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of \\npeople that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of \\nturmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a  \\npaycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running \\ntheir lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in \\ncontrol of their emotions and their souls.”\\nRich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard \\nwhat he said but didn’t understand fully what he was talking about.  \\nI just knew that I often wondered why grown-ups hurried off to \\nwork. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that \\nhappy, but something kept them going.\\nRealizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was \\ntalking about, rich dad said, “I want you boys to avoid that trap.  \\nThat is really what I want to teach you.

It’s perfectly normal to desire something \\nbetter, prettier, more fun, or exciting. So people also work for money \\nbecause of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. \\nBut the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need \\nmore money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more \\nsecurity. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls \\nthat are troubled by fear and desire. But money can’t do that.”\\n“Even rich people do this?” Mike asked.\\n“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich \\npeople are rich isn’t because of desire, but because of fear. They believe \\nthat money can eliminate the fear of being poor, so they amass tons of it, \\nonly to find the fear gets worse. Now they fear losing the money. I have \\nfriends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people \\nwho have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. \\nThey’re terrified of losing it all. The fears that drove them to get rich \\ngot worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming \\nlouder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life \\nmoney has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say \\nif they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, \\nalthough they look rich and have more money.”\\n“So is a poor man happier?” I asked.\\n“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money \\nis just as psychotic as being attached to money.”\\nAs if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by \\nthe large rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us \\nwatched him with great interest, when before we probably would \\nhave just ignored him.\\nRich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the \\nolder man. Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately, \\ntook the bill, thanked rich dad profusely, and hurried off, ecstatic \\nwith his good fortune.\\n“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich \\ndad. “I’ve met so many people who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 45}),\n",

If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working? \\nThat kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who \\nhoards money.” \\nAs I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind flashed back to \\nthe countless times my own dad said, “I’m not interested in money.” \\nHe said those words often. He also \\ncovered himself by always saying,  \\n“I work because I love my job.”\\n“So what do we do?” I asked. “Not \\nwork for money until all traces of fear \\nand greed are gone?”\\n“No, that would be a waste of time,” \\nsaid rich dad. “Emotions are what make \\nus human. The word ‘emotion’ stands for ‘energy in motion.’ Be \\ntruthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in \\nyour favor, not against yourself.”\\n“Whoa!” said Mike.\\n“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in \\nyears to come. Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. \\nMost people do not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the \\nthinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn \\nto do your own thinking.”\\n“Can you give me an example?” I asked.\\n“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, ‘I need to find \\na job,’ it’s most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not \\nhaving money generates that thought.”\\n“But people do need money if they have bills to pay,” I said.\\n“Sure they do,” smiled rich dad. “All I’m saying is that it’s fear that \\nis all too often doing the thinking.”\\n“I don’t understand,” said Mike.\\n“For example,” said rich dad. “If the fear of not having enough \\nmoney arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job, they \\ninstead might ask themselves this question: ‘Will a job be the best  So many people say,  \\n“Oh, I’m not  \\ninterested in money.”  \\nYet they’ll work  \\nat a job for  \\neight hours a day.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 46}),\n",

A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem.”\\n“But my dad is always saying, ‘Stay in school and get good grades, \\nso you can find a safe, secure job,’” I interjected, somewhat confused. \\n“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people \\nrecommend that, and it’s a good path for most people. But people make \\nthat recommendation primarily out of fear.”\\n“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?”\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t earn enough \\nmoney and won’t fit into society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you \\nand wants the best for you. I too believe an education and a job are \\nimportant, but it won’t handle the fear. You see, that same fear that \\nmakes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that  \\nis causing him to be so fanatical about your going to school.”\\n“So what do you recommend?” I asked.\\n“I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of  \\nbeing afraid of it. They don’t teach that in school and, if you don’t  \\nlearn it, you become a slave to money.”\\nIt was finally making sense. He wanted us to widen our views  \\nand to see what the Mrs. Martins of this world couldn’t see. He used \\nexamples that sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten \\nthem. My vision widened that day, and I began to see the trap that  \\nlay ahead for most people.\\n“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different \\nlevels,” said rich dad. “I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid \\nthe trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in \\nyour favor, not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not \\ninterested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t \\nhandle the fear or desire. If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and \\nyou get rich, you’ll only be a highly paid slave.”\\n“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked.\\n“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and  \\nignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich.

My highly educated dad \\nhad a great education and a great career, but school never told him \\nhow to handle money or his fear of it. It became clear that I could \\nlearn different and important things from two fathers. \\n“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How \\ndoes the desire for money affect our thinking?” Mike asked. \\n“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you \\nnotice your desires rising?”\\nWe nodded our heads.\\n“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay  \\nyour reactions and think. That is important. We will always have \\nemotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it’s imperative for you \\nto use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not \\nlet your emotions control your thinking. Most people use fear and \\ngreed against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people \\nlive their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because \\nof the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those \\nemotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of \\na donkey dragging a cart with its owner dangling a carrot just in front \\nof its nose.

That is why rich \\npeople with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get. \\nMoney is the carrot, the illusion.

That struggle is a moment-to-\\nmoment decision—to learn to open or close one’s mind.\\n“Look, school is very important. You go to school to learn a skill  \\nor profession to become a contributing member of society. Every  \\nculture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, businesspeople, \\npolice officers, firefighters, and soldiers. Schools train them so society \\ncan thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people \\nschool is the end, not the beginning.”\\nThere was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I didn’t \\ncomprehend everything he said that day. But as with most great \\nteachers, his words continued to teach for years. \\n“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. “But I want you \\nto always remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. \\nMartin. And I want you always to remember that donkey. Never \\nforget that fear and desire can lead you into life’s biggest trap if you’re \\nnot aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life \\nliving in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for \\nmoney, thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy \\nis also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about \\npaying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size \\nof a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job makes you  \\nsecure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want  \\nyou to avoid. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that \\nhappen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”\\nA softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw  \\nit back.\\n“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked. \\n“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed \\nand fear,” said rich dad. “Let me give you some examples.

Soon there \\nwill be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos \\nwill break out and another great civilization will collapse. History \\nproves that great civilizations collapse when the gap between the haves \\nand have-nots is too great. Sadly, America is on that same course \\nbecause we haven’t learned from history. We only memorize historical \\ndates and names, not the lesson.”\\n“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked.\\n“In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should  \\nactually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory. \\nPrices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools \\ntaught people about money, there would be more money and lower \\nprices. But schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, \\nnot how to harness money’s power.”\\n“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “And haven’t \\nyou encouraged me to go for my MBA?”\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often business schools train  \\nemployees to become sophisticated bean-counters. Heaven forbid a bean-\\ncounter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire \\npeople, and kill the business. I know this because I hire bean-counters. \\nAll they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more \\nproblems. Bean-counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but \\nit, too, is not the whole picture,” added rich dad angrily.\\n“So is there an answer?” asked Mike.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not \\nthink with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions  \\nby agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope.

Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions. \\nInstead of just getting up and going to work because not having the \\nmoney to pay your bills is scaring you, ask yourself, ‘Is working harder \\nat this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are too afraid to \\nrationally think things through and instead run out the door to a job \\nthey hate.

I’ll teach you to have a choice of \\nthoughts rather than a knee-jerk reaction, like gulping down your \\nmorning coffee and running out the door.\\n“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term \\nsolution to a long-term problem.

Money controls their lives, or should I say the fear and \\nignorance about money controls it.

You can’t push me around.’ Or ‘I like \\nthis job because it’s secure.’ No one asks, ‘Is there something I’m  \\nmissing here?’ which would break through the emotional thought  \\nand give you time to think clearly.”\\nAs we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich \\nreally did “make money.” They did not work for it. He went on to \\nexplain that when Mike and I were casting five-cent pieces out of \\nlead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking \\nthe way the rich think. The problem was that creating money is legal \\nfor the government and banks to do, but illegal for us to do.

The point is this: Today we live in times of \\ngreater and faster change than these men did.

Company pension plans are being \\nreplaced by 401(k) plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and \\ncan’t be relied upon as a source for retirement. Panic has set in for  \\nthe middle class. \\nToday, mutual funds are popular because they supposedly \\nrepresent safety. Average mutual-fund buyers are too busy working to \\npay taxes and mortgages, save for their children’s college, and pay off \\ncredit cards. They do not have time to study investing, so they rely \\non the expertise of the manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the \\nmutual fund includes many different types of investments, they feel \\ntheir money is safer because it is “diversified.” This educated middle \\nclass subscribes to the dogma put out by mutual-fund brokers and \\nfinancial planners: “Play it safe. Avoid risk.”\\nThe real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what \\ncreates the risk faced by average middle-class people. The reason they have \\nto play it safe is because their financial positions are tenuous at best. Their \\nbalance sheets are not balanced. Instead, they are loaded with liabilities \\nand have no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source \\nof income is their paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent \\non their employer.

For people who hate real estate, \\nthey shouldn’t buy it.\\nI also love stocks of small companies, especially start-ups, because  \\nI am an entrepreneur, not a corporate person. In my early years,  \\nI worked in large organizations, such as Standard Oil of California,  \\nthe U.S. Marine Corps, and Xerox Corp. I enjoyed my time with \\nthose organizations and have fond memories, but I know deep down  \\nI am not a company man. I like starting companies, not running \\nthem. So my stock buys are usually of small companies. Sometimes \\nI even start the company and take it public. Fortunes are made in \\nnew stock issues, and I love the game. Many people are afraid of \\nsmall-cap companies and call them risky, and they are. But that risk \\nis diminished if you love what the \\ninvestment is, understand it, and know \\nthe game. With small companies, my \\ninvestment strategy is to be out of the \\nstock in a year. On the other hand, my \\nreal estate strategy is to start small and \\nkeep trading up for bigger properties \\nand, therefore, delay paying taxes on the gain. This allows the value to \\nincrease dramatically. I generally hold real estate less than seven years.\\nFor years, even while I was with the Marine Corps and Xerox,  \\nI did what my rich dad recommended. I kept my day job, but I still \\nminded my own business. I was active in my asset column trading real \\nestate and small stocks. Rich dad always stressed the importance of \\nfinancial literacy. The better I was at understanding the accounting and \\ncash management, the better I would be at analyzing investments and \\neventually starting and building my own company.Start minding your own \\nbusiness.

But \\nthe odds are against success: Nine out of ten companies fail in five  \\nyears. Of those that survive the first five years, nine out of every ten  \\nof those eventually fail as well. So only if you really have the desire to \\nown your own company do I recommend it. Otherwise, keep your \\nday job and mind your own business.\\nWhen I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep \\nyour asset column strong.

An  \\nimportant distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the \\npoor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.

They look rich, but  \\nin reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The old-money \\npeople, the long-term rich, build their asset column first.

The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the \\nRobin Hood ideal. The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the \\nmiddle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who \\npays for the poor.\\nAgain, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look  \\nat the history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an  \\nexpert on the history of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as  \\nan expert on the history of taxes.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 93}),\n",

Occasionally, there were temporary \\ntaxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the president would \\nput the word out and ask everyone to “chip in.” Taxes were levied in \\nBritain for the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in \\nAmerica to pay for the Civil War from 1861 to 1865.\\nIn 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. \\nIn 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with \\nthe adoption of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. At one \\ntime, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the tax on tea that led to the \\nfamous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the \\nRevolutionary War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and \\nthe United States to sell the idea of a regular income tax.\\nWhat these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes \\nwere initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad \\nwanted Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes \\nwas made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and \\nthe middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is \\nhow the masses voted for the law, and it became constitutionally legal. \\nAlthough it was intended to punish the rich, in reality it wound up \\npunishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class.\\n“Once government got a taste of money, its appetite grew,” said rich \\ndad. “Your dad and I are exactly opposite. He’s a government bureaucrat, \\nand I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our success is measured on \\nopposite behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The \\nmore he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization \\nbecomes. In the government, a large organization is a respected \\norganization. On the other hand, within my organization, the fewer \\npeople I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am respected by my \\ninvestors. That’s why I don’t like government people. They have different \\nobjectives than most business people.

It was not easy to know which dad \\nto believe.\\nYet when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective \\nemerges. As I said, the passage of taxes was only possible because the \\nmasses believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics: Take from the \\nrich, and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government’s \\nappetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on \\nthe middle class, and from there it kept trickling down.\\nHowever, the rich saw an opportunity because they don’t play by \\nthe same set of rules. The rich knew about corporations, which became \\npopular in the days of sailing ships. The rich created the corporation \\nas a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each voyage. The rich put \\ntheir money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation \\nwould then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasure. If \\nthe ship was lost, the crew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would \\nbe limited only to the money they invested for that particular voyage.

Having two \\nfathers teaching me, one a socialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly \\nbegan to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist made more financial \\nsense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized \\nthemselves due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the \\n“take-from-the-rich” crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to \\noutsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle \\nclass. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood \\nthe power of money, a subject not taught in schools.\\nHow did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the “take-from-\\nthe-rich” tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers. \\nInitially, people were happy. Money was handed out to government \\nworkers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of  \\njobs and pensions, and it went to the rich via their factories receiving \\ngovernment contracts. The government received a large pool of money, \\nbut the problem was the fiscal management of that money. The \\ngovernment ideal is to avoid having excess money. If you fail to spend \\nyour allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would \\ncertainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the \\nother hand, are rewarded for having excess money and are applauded for \\ntheir efficiency.

A corporation is merely a \\nfile folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s \\noffice and registered with a state government agency. It’s not a big \\nbuilding or a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a \\nlegal document that creates a legal body without a soul.

They use their resources to effect change.\\nThe Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to reduce \\ntaxes.

For \\nexample, “1031” is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue \\nCode which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate \\nthat is sold for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive \\npiece of real estate.

I just could not pass \\nup these small deals.\\nHouses that were once $100,000 were now $75,000. But instead \\nof shopping with local real estate agents, I began shopping at the \\nbankruptcy attorney’s office, or the courthouse steps. In these  \\nshopping places, a $75,000 house could sometimes be bought for \\n$20,000 or less. For $2,000, which was loaned to me from a friend \\nfor 90 days for $200, I gave an attorney a cashier’s check as a down \\npayment. While the acquisition was being processed, I ran an ad \\nadvertising a $75,000 house for only $60,000 and no money down.

My capital \\ngains of approximately $40,000 were placed into a 1031 tax-deferred \\nexchange, and I went shopping for a place to put my money. In about \\na month, I found a 12-unit apartment house right next to the Intel \\nplant in Beaverton, Oregon. The owners lived in Germany, had no idea \\nwhat the place was worth, and again, \\njust wanted to get out of it. I offered \\n$275,000 for a $450,000 building. \\nThey agreed to $300,000. I bought it \\nand held it for two years. Utilizing the \\nsame 1031-exchange process, we sold \\nthe building for $495,000 and bought a \\n30-unit apartment building in Phoenix, \\nArizona. We had moved to Phoenix by then to get out of the rain, and \\nneeded to sell anyway. Like the former Oregon market, the real estate \\nmarket in Phoenix was depressed. The price of the 30-unit apartment \\nbuilding in Phoenix was $875,000, with $225,000 down. The cash \\nflow from the 30 units was a little over $5,000 a month.\\nThe Arizona market began moving up and, a few years later, a \\nColorado investor offered us $1.2 million for the property.\\nThe point of this example is how a small amount can grow into \\na large amount. Again, it is a matter of understanding financial \\nstatements, investment strategies, a sense of the market, and the laws. \\nIf people are not versed in these subjects, then obviously they must  \\nfollow standard dogma, which is to play it safe, diversify, and only \\ninvest in secure investments.

And that is a wise policy. \\nThe really hot deals are not offered to people who are novices. Often, \\nthe best deals that make the rich even richer are reserved for those who \\nunderstand the game. It is technically illegal to offer speculative deals to \\nsomeone who is considered not sophisticated, but of course it happens. \\nThe more sophisticated I get, the more opportunities come my way. \\nAnother case for developing your financial intelligence over a \\nlifetime is simply that more opportunities are presented to you. And \\nthe greater your financial intelligence, the easier it is to tell whether \\na deal is good. It’s your intelligence that can spot a bad deal, or make \\na bad deal good. The more I learn—and there is a lot to learn—the \\nmore money I make simply because I gain experience and wisdom as \\nthe years go on. I have friends who are playing it safe, working hard at \\ntheir profession, and failing to gain financial wisdom, which does take \\ntime to develop.\\nMy overall philosophy is to plant seeds inside my asset column  \\nThat is my formula. I start small and plant seeds. Some grow; some \\ndon’t. Inside our real estate corporation, we have property worth several \\nmillion dollars. It is our own REIT, or real estate investment trust.\\nThe point I’m making is that most of those millions started out \\nas little $5,000 to $10,000 investments. All of those down payments \\nwere fortunate to catch a fast-rising market and increase tax-free. We \\ntraded in and out several times over a number of years.\\nWe also own a stock portfolio, surrounded by a corporation that \\nKim and I call our “personal mutual fund.” We have friends who deal \\nspecifically with investors like us who have extra money each month \\nto invest. We buy high-risk, speculative private companies that are \\njust about to go public on a stock exchange in the United States or \\nCanada. An example of how fast gains can be made are 100,000 shares \\npurchased for 25 cents each before the company goes public. Six \\nmonths later, the company is listed, and the 100,000 shares now are \\nworth $2 each. If the company is well managed, the price keeps going \\nup, and the stock may go to $20 or more per share.

It is financial intelligence that improves the odds. Thus, \\nwhat is risky for one person is less risky to someone else. That is the \\nprimary reason I constantly encourage people to invest more in their \\nfinancial education than in stocks, real estate, or other markets.

But if you \\nwill reread why investments such as these are high-risk for most people, \\nyou may be able to set your life up differently, so that the ability to take \\n$25,000 and turn it into $1 million in a year is low-risk for you.\\nAs stated earlier, nothing I have written is a recommendation. It \\nis only used as an example of what is simple and possible. What I do \\nis small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.

Depending on the \\nmarket and how smart you are, it could \\nbe done in five to 10 years. If you keep \\nyour living expenses modest, $100,000 \\ncoming in as additional income is \\npleasant, regardless of whether you \\nwork. You can work if you like or take time off if you choose and use \\nthe government tax system in your favor, rather than against you.\\nMy personal basis is real estate. I love real estate because it’s stable \\nand slow-moving. I keep the base solid. The cash flow is fairly steady \\nand, if properly managed, has a good chance of increasing in value. \\nThe beauty of a solid base of real estate is that it allows me to take \\ngreater risks, as I do with speculative stocks.It is not gambling if \\nyou know what you’re \\ndoing.

Everyone wondered why he bought it.  \\nWhat he saw that we did not was that the house came with \\nfour extra empty lots. He discovered that after going to the \\ntitle company. After buying the house, he tore the house \\ndown and sold the five lots to a builder for three times what \\nhe paid for the entire package. He made $75,000 for two \\nmonths of work. It’s not a lot of money, but it sure beats \\nminimum wage. And it’s not technically difficult.\\n2. Raise money.  \\nThe average person only goes to the bank. This second type  \\nof investor needs to know how to raise capital, and there are \\nmany ways that don’t require a bank. To get started, I learned \\nhow to buy houses without a bank. It was the learned skill  \\nof raising money, more than the houses themselves, that  \\nwas priceless.\\n All too often I hear people say, “The bank won’t lend me  \\nmoney,” or “I don’t have the money to buy it.” If you want to \\nbe a type-two investor, you need to learn how to do that which \\nstops most people. In other words, a majority of people let their \\nlack of money stop them from making a deal. If you can avoid \\nthat obstacle, you will be millions ahead of those who don’t \\nlearn those skills.

Often I recommend joining a network-marketing \\ncompany, also called multilevel marketing, if they want to learn sales \\nskills. Some of these companies have excellent training programs that \\nhelp people get over their fear of failure and rejection, which are the \\nmain reasons people are unsuccessful. Education is more valuable \\nthan money, in the long run.\\nWhen I offer this suggestion, I often hear in response, “Oh that is \\ntoo much hassle,” or “I only want to do what I am interested in.”\\nIf they say, “It’s too much of a hassle,” I ask, “So you would  \\nrather work all your life giving 50 percent of what you earn to the \\ngovernment?” If they tell me, “I only do what I am interested in,”   ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 136}),\n",

Although the unions came \\nclose, rich dad was always able to fight them off. \\nPersonally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and \\nthe benefits of both sides. If you do as school recommends, become \\nhighly specialized. Then seek union protection. For example, had I \\ncontinued with my flying career, I would have sought a company that \\nhad a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated \\nto learning a skill that was valuable in only one industry. If I were \\npushed out of that industry, my life’s skills would not be as valuable \\nto another industry. A displaced senior pilot—with 100,000 hours of \\nheavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year—would have a \\nhard time finding an equivalent high-paying job teaching in school. \\nSkills do not necessarily transfer from industry to industry.

It doesn’t take much \\neducation, but those doubts are cripplers for most people.\\n“Cynics never win,” said rich dad. “Unchecked doubt and fear  \\ncreates a cynic.” “Cynics criticize, and winners analyze” was another \\nof his favorite sayings. Rich dad explained that criticism blinded while \\nanalysis opened eyes. Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were \\nblind, and to see opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding \\nwhat people miss is key to any success.\\nReal estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking  \\nfinancial independence or freedom. It is a unique investment tool.  \\nYet every time I mention real estate as a vehicle, I often hear, “I don’t \\nwant to fix toilets.” That’s what Peter Lynch calls noise. That’s what  \\nmy rich dad would say is the cynic talking, someone who criticizes and \\ndoes not analyze, someone who lets their doubts and fears close their \\nmind instead of open their eyes.\\nSo when someone says, “I don’t want to fix toilets,” I want to fire \\nback, “What makes you think I want to?” They’re saying a toilet is  \\nmore important than what they want. I talk about freedom from the \\nRat Race, and they focus on toilets. That is the thought pattern that \\nkeeps most people poor. They criticize instead of analyze.\\n“I-don’t-wants hold the key to your success,” rich dad would say.  \\nBecause I, too, do not want to fix toilets, I shop hard for a property  \\nmanager who does fix toilets. And by finding a great property manager \\nwho runs houses or apartments, well, my cash flow goes up. But, more \\nimportantly, a great property manager allows me to buy a lot more real \\nestate since I don’t have to fix toilets. A great property manager is key to \\nsuccess in real estate. Finding a good manager is more important to me \\nthan the real estate. A great property manager often hears of great deals \\nbefore real estate agents do, which makes them even more valuable.\\nThat is what rich dad meant by “I-don’t-wants hold the key to \\nyour success.” Because I do not want to fix toilets either, I figured out ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 151}),\n",

The people who continue to say “I don’t want to fix toilets” often \\ndeny themselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are \\nmore important than their freedom.\\nIn the stock market, I often hear people say, “I don’t want to lose \\nmoney.” Well, what makes them think I or anyone else likes losing  \\nmoney? They don’t make money because they choose to not lose  \\nmoney. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful \\ninvestment vehicle, the stock market.\\nI was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas station. He \\nlooked up and saw that the price of gas was going up and thus the \\nprice of oil. My friend is a worry wart or a Chicken Little. To him, the \\nsky is always going to fall, and it usually does, on him.\\nWhen we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the  \\nprice of oil was going to go up over the next few years, statistics I had \\nnever seen before, even though I already owned substantial shares of  \\nan existing oil company. With that information, I immediately began \\nlooking for and found a new, undervalued oil company that was  \\nabout to find some oil deposits. My broker was excited about this  \\nnew company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per share.\\nThree months later, this same friend and I drove by the same gas \\nstation, and sure enough, the price per gallon had gone up nearly  \\n15 percent. Again, the Chicken Little worried and complained. I \\nsmiled because, a month earlier, that little oil company hit oil and \\nthose 15,000 shares went up to more than $3 per share since he had \\nfirst given me the tip. And the price of gas will continue to go up if \\nwhat my friend says is true. \\nIf most people understood how a “stop” worked in stock-market  \\ninvesting, there would be more people investing to win instead of  \\ninvesting not to lose. A stop is simply a computer command that  \\nsells your stock automatically if the price begins to drop, helping to \\nminimize your losses and maximize some gains. It’s a great tool for \\nthose who are terrified of losing.\\nSo whenever I hear people focusing on their I-don’t-wants, rather \\nthan what they do want, I know the noise in their head must be loud. \\nChicken Little has taken over their brain and is yelling, “The sky is ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 152}),\n",

They may never get what they want in life.  \\nInstead of analyzing, their inner Chicken Little closes their mind. \\nRich dad gave me a way of looking at Chicken Little. “Just do what \\nColonel Sanders did.” At the age of 66, he lost his business and began \\nto live on his Social Security check. It wasn’t enough. He went around \\nthe country selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down \\n1,009 times before someone said yes. And he went on to become a \\nmultimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting. “He was a \\nbrave and tenacious man,” rich dad said of Harlan Sanders.\\nSo when you’re in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what \\nColonel Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it.\\nOvercoming Laziness\\nBusy people are often the most lazy. We have all heard stories of a  \\nbusinessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be a \\ngood provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the \\noffice and brings work home on weekends. One day he comes home \\nto an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and \\nhis wife had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship \\nstrong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his performance at work \\nslips and he loses his job.\\nToday, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their \\nwealth. And there are people too busy to take care of their health. The \\ncause is the same. They’re busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding \\nsomething they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep \\ndown they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with \\nanger or irritation.\\nIf they aren’t busy at work or with the kids, they’re often busy \\nwatching TV, fishing, playing golf, or shopping. Yet deep down \\nthey know they are avoiding something important. That’s the most \\ncommon form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.\\nSo what is the cure for laziness? The answer is—a little greed.\\nFor many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad. \\n“Greedy people are bad people,” my mom used to say. Yet we all have \\ninside of us this yearning to have nice, new, or exciting things. ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 153}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles140\\nSo to keep that emotion of desire under control, often parents  \\nfind ways of suppressing that desire with guilt. “You only think about \\nyourself. Don’t you know you have brothers and sisters?” was one of \\nmy mom’s favorites. “You want me to buy you what?” was a favorite of \\nmy dad. “Do you think we’re made of money? Do you think money \\ngrows on trees? We’re not rich people, you know.”\\nIt wasn’t so much the words, but the angry guilt trip that went \\nwith the words that got to me.\\nOr the reverse guilt trip was the “I’m sacrificing my life to buy  \\nthis for you. I’m buying this for you because I never had this advantage \\nwhen I was a kid.” I have a neighbor who is stone-broke but can’t park \\nhis car in his garage. The garage is filled with toys for his kids. Those \\nspoiled brats get everything they ask for.  \\n“I don’t want them to know the \\nfeeling of want” are his everyday \\nwords. He has nothing set aside for \\ntheir college or his retirement, but \\nhis kids have every toy ever made. \\nHe recently got a new credit card in \\nthe mail and took his kids to visit Las \\nVegas. “I’m doing it for the kids,” he \\nsaid with great sacrifice.\\nRich dad forbade the words, “I can’t afford it.” In my real home, \\nthat’s all I heard. Instead, rich dad required his children to say, “How \\ncan I afford it?” He believed that the words “I can’t afford it” shut \\ndown your brain. It didn’t have to think anymore. “How can I afford \\nit?” opened up the brain and forced it to think and search for answers.\\nBut most importantly, he felt the words, “I can’t afford it,” were \\na lie. And the human spirit knows it. “The human spirit is very, very \\npowerful,” he would say. “It knows it can do anything.” By having a \\nlazy mind that says, “I can’t afford it,” a war breaks out inside you. Your \\nspirit is angry, and your lazy mind must defend its lie. The spirit is \\nscreaming, “Come on. Let’s go to the gym and work out.” And the lazy \\nmind says, “But I’m tired. I worked really hard today.” Or the human Rich dad believed  \\nthat the words  \\n“I can’t afford it”  \\nshut down your brain. \\n“How can I afford it?” \\nopens up possibilities, \\nexcitement, and dreams.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 154}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad141\\nspirit says, “I’m sick and tired of being poor. Let’s get out there and get \\nrich.” To which the lazy mind says, “Rich people are greedy. Besides it’s \\ntoo much bother. It’s not safe. I might lose money. I’m working hard \\nenough as it is. I’ve got too much to do at work anyway. Look at what  \\nI have to do tonight. My boss wants it finished by morning.”\\n“I can’t afford it” also causes sadness, a helplessness that leads \\nto despondency and often depression. “How can I afford it?” opens \\nup possibilities, excitement, and dreams. So rich dad was not so \\nconcerned about what we wanted to buy as long as we understood that \\n“How can I afford it?” creates a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit.\\nThus he rarely gave Mike or me anything. He would instead ask, \\n“How can you afford it?” and that included college, which we paid  \\nfor ourselves. It was not the goal, but the process of attaining the goal  \\nthat he wanted us to learn.\\nThe problem I see today is that there are millions of people who \\nfeel guilty about their desire or their “greed.” It’s old conditioning  \\nfrom their childhood. While they desire to have the finer things that \\nlife offers, most have been conditioned subconsciously to say, “I can’t \\nhave that,” or “I’ll never be able to afford that.”\\nWhen I decided to exit the Rat Race, it was simply a question \\nof “How can I afford to never work again?” And my mind began to \\nkick out answers and solutions. The hardest part was fighting my real \\nparents’ dogma: “We can’t afford that.” “Stop thinking only about  \\nyourself.”  “Why don’t you think about others?” and other similar  \\nsentiments designed to instill guilt to suppress my “greed.”\\nSo how do you beat laziness? Once again, the answer is a little \\ngreed. It’s that radio station WII-FM, which stands for “What’s In  \\nIt For Me?” A person needs to sit down and ask, “What would my \\nlife be like if I never had to work again?” “What would I do if I had \\nall the money I needed?” Without that little greed, the desire to have \\nsomething better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because \\nwe all desire a better life. New inventions are made because we desire \\nsomething better. We go to school and study hard because we want \\nsomething better.

       " Document(page_content='Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles142\\nyou know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is, \\n“What’s in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness.\\nToo much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good. \\nBut just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street : \\n“Greed is good.” Rich dad said it differently: “Guilt is worse than greed, \\nfor guilt robs the body of its soul.” I think Eleanor Roosevelt said it best: \\n“Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you’ll be criticized \\nanyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”\\nOvercoming Bad Habits\\nOur lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education. After \\nseeing the movie Conan the Barbarian,  starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, \\na friend said, “I’d love to have a body like Schwarzenegger.” Most of the \\nguys nodded in agreement.\\n“I even heard he was really puny and skinny at one time,” another \\nfriend added.\\n“Yeah, I heard that too,” another one said. “I heard he has a habit of \\nworking out almost every day in the gym.”\\n“Yeah, I’ll bet he has to.”\\n“Nah,” said the group cynic. “I’ll bet he was born that way. Besides, \\nlet’s stop talking about Arnold and get some beers.”\\nThis is an example of habits controlling behavior. I remember  \\nasking my rich dad about the habits of the rich. Instead of answering me \\noutright, he wanted me to learn through example, as usual.\\n“When does your dad pay his bills?” rich dad asked.\\n“The first of the month,” I said.\\n“Does he have anything left over?” he asked.\\n“Very little,” I said.\\n“That’s the main reason he struggles,” said rich dad. “He has  \\nbad habits. Your dad pays everyone else first. He pays himself last, but \\nonly if he has anything left over.”\\n“Which he usually doesn’t,” I said. “But he has to pay his bills, doesn’t \\nhe? You’re saying he shouldn’t pay his bills?”', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad143\\n“Of course not,” said rich dad. “I firmly believe in paying my bills on \\ntime. I just pay myself first. Before I pay even the government.”\\n“But what happens if you don’t have enough money?” I asked.  \\n“What do you do then?”\\n“The same,” said rich dad. “I still pay myself first. Even if I’m  \\nshort of money. My asset column is far more important to me than  \\nthe government.”\\n“But,” I said. “Don’t they come after you?”\\n“Yes, if you don’t pay,” said rich dad. “Look, I did not say not to pay. \\nI just said I pay myself first, even if I’m short of money.”\\n“But,” I replied. “How do you do that?” \\n“It’s not how. The question is ‘Why?’” rich dad said.\\n“Okay, why?”\\n“Motivation,” said rich dad. “Who do you think will complain \\nlouder if I don’t pay them—me, or my creditors?”\\n“Your creditors will definitely scream louder than you,” I said,  \\nresponding to the obvious. “You wouldn’t say anything if you didn’t  \\npay yourself.” \\n“So you see, after paying myself, the pressure to pay my taxes and \\nthe other creditors is so great that it forces me to seek other forms of \\nincome. The pressure to pay becomes my motivation. I’ve worked extra \\njobs, started other companies, traded in the stock market, anything just \\nto make sure those guys don’t start yelling at me. That pressure made me \\nwork harder, forced me to think, and all in all, made me smarter and \\nmore active when it comes to money. If I had paid myself last, I would \\nhave felt no pressure, but I’d be broke.”\\n“So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money \\nto that motivates you?”\\n“That’s right,” said rich dad. “You see, government bill collectors are \\nbig bullies. So are bill collectors in general. Most people give into these \\nbullies. They pay them and never pay themselves. You know the story of \\nthe 98-pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?”\\nI nodded. “I see that ad for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons  \\nin the comic books all the time.”', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",

The \\nmore I work my mental money muscles out, the stronger I get. Now I’m \\nnot afraid of those bullies.”\\nI liked what rich dad was saying. “So if I pay myself first, I get \\nfinancially stronger, mentally and fiscally.”\\nRich dad nodded.\\n“And if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like \\nbosses, managers, tax collectors, bill collectors, and landlords push me \\naround all my life—just because I don’t have good money habits.” \\nRich dad nodded. “Just like the 98-pound weakling.”\\nOvercoming Arrogance \\n“What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me \\nmoney. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money.

Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit \\nIf you ask most people if they would like to be rich or financially \\nfree, they would say yes. But then reality sets in. The road seems too \\nlong with too many hills to climb. It’s easier to just work for money  \\nand hand the excess over to your broker.\\nI once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming for  \\nthe U.S. Olympic team. The reality was that she had to get up every \\nmorning at four o’clock to swim for three hours before going to \\nschool. She did not party with her friends on Saturday night. She had \\nto study and keep her grades up, just like everyone else.\\nWhen I asked her what fueled her super-human ambition and  \\nsacrifice, she simply said, “I do it for myself and the people I love. It’s  \\nlove that gets me over the hurdles and sacrifices.”\\nA reason or a purpose is a combination of “wants” and “don’t \\nwants.” When people ask me what my reason for wanting to be rich \\nis, I tell them that it is a combination of deep emotional “wants” and \\n“don’t wants.”\\nI will list a few: first, the “don’t wants,” for they create the “wants.”  \\nI don’t want to work all my life. I don’t want what my parents aspired for,  \\nwhich was job security and a house in the suburbs.  I don’t like being an \\nemployee.

The rich don’t do that. They work hard and pass it on \\nto their children.\\nNow the “wants.” I want to be free to travel the world and live \\nin the lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this. I want \\nto simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want \\nmoney to work for me.\\nThose are my deep-seated emotional reasons. What are yours?  \\nIf they are not strong enough, then the reality of the road ahead may  \\nbe greater than your reasons.

Many rich families lose their assets in the next \\ngeneration simply because there was no one trained to be a good \\nsteward over their assets.\\nMost people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population, \\nbeing rich is too much of a hassle. So they invent sayings that go: “I’m \\nnot interested in money.” “I’ll never be rich.” “I don’t have to worry. \\nI’m still young.” “When I make some money, then I’ll think about my \\nfuture.” “My husband/wife handles the finances.” The problem with \\nthose statements is that they rob the person who chooses to think such \\nthoughts of two things: One is time, which is your most precious asset. \\nThe second is learning. Having no money should not be an excuse to  \\nnot learn. But that is a choice we all make daily: the choice of what we  \\ndo with our time, our money, and what we put in our heads. That is  \\nthe power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and  \\nI make that choice every day.\\nInvest first in education. In reality, the only real asset you have is your \\nmind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over. Each of us has the \\nchoice of what we put in our brain once we’re old enough. You can watch \\nTV, read golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial \\nplanning. You choose. Most people simply buy investments rather than \\nfirst investing in learning about investing.\\nA friend of mine recently had her apartment burglarized. The \\nthieves took her electronics and left all the books.

Why should they? \\nThey are the center of the universe.\\nThere are so many “intelligent” people who argue or defend when \\na new idea clashes with the way they think. In this case, their so-called \\nintelligence combined with arrogance equals ignorance. Each of us \\nknows people who are highly educated, or believe they are smart, but \\ntheir balance sheet paints a different picture. A truly intelligent person \\nwelcomes new ideas, for new ideas can add to the synergy of other  \\naccumulated ideas. Listening is more important than talking. If that \\nwere not true, God would not have given us two ears and only one \\nmouth. Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening  \\nin order to absorb new ideas and possibilities. They argue instead of \\nasking questions.\\nI take a long view on my wealth. I do not subscribe to the  \\nget-rich-quick mentality most lottery players or casino gamblers have.  \\nI may go in and out of stocks, but I am long on education. If you  \\nwant to fly an airplane, I advise taking lessons first. I am always  \\nshocked at people who buy stocks or real estate, but never invest in \\ntheir greatest asset, their mind.

Choose friends carefully: the power of association\\nFirst of all, I do not choose my friends by their financial statements. \\nI have friends who have actually taken a vow of poverty as well as friends \\nwho earn millions every year. The point is that I learn from all of them.\\nNow, I will admit that there are people I have actually sought out \\nbecause they had money. But I was not after their money; I was  \\nseeking their knowledge. In some cases, these people who had money \\nhave become dear friends. I’ve noticed that my friends with money \\ntalk about money. They don’t do it to brag. They’re interested in the \\nsubject. So I learn from them, and they learn from me. My friends \\nwho are in dire financial straits do not like talking about money, \\nbusiness, or investing. They often think it rude or unintellectual. So \\nI also learn from my friends who struggle financially. I find out what \\nnot to do.\\nI have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in \\ntheir short lifetimes. The three of them report the same phenomenon: \\nTheir friends who have no money have never come to them to ask \\nthem how they did it. But they do come asking for one of two things, \\nor both: a loan, or a job.\\nWARNING: Don’t listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, and \\nwhile I love them dearly, they are the Chicken Littles of life. To them, when it \\ncomes to money, especially investments, it’s always, “The sky is falling! The sky \\nis falling!” They can always tell you why something won’t work. The problem \\nis that people listen to them. But people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom \\ninformation are also Chicken Littles. As that old saying goes, “Birds of a feather \\nflock together.”\\nIf you watch business channels on TV, they often have a panel \\nof so-called experts. One expert will say the market is going to crash, \\nand the other will say it’s going to boom. If you’re smart, you listen \\nto both. Keep your mind open, because both have valid points. \\nUnfortunately, most poor people listen to Chicken Little.\\nI have had many close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an \\ninvestment. Not long ago, a friend told me he was excited because he \\nfound a 6 percent certificate of deposit.

I have received 16 percent for \\nyears now, and he still receives 6 percent.\\nI would say that one of the hardest things about wealth-building is \\nto be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd. \\nThis is because, in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up \\nlate that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it’s too late \\nin most instances. Look for a new deal. As we used to say as surfers: \\n“There is always another wave.” People who hurry and catch a wave \\nlate usually are the ones who wipe out.\\nSmart investors don’t time the markets. If they miss a wave, they \\nsearch for the next one and get themselves in position. This is hard \\nfor most investors because buying what is not popular is frightening. \\nTimid investors are like sheep going along with the crowd. Or their \\ngreed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their \\nprofits and moved on. Wise investors buy an investment when it’s not \\npopular. They know their profits are made when they buy, not when \\nthey sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do not time the market. \\nJust like a surfer, they get in position for the next big swell.\\nIt’s all “insider trading.” There are forms of insider trading that are \\nillegal, and there are forms of insider trading that are legal. But either \\nway, it’s insider trading. The only distinction is: How far away from \\nthe inside are you? The reason you want to have rich friends is because \\nthat is where the money is made. It’s made on information. You want \\nto hear about the next boom, get in, and get out before the next bust. \\nI’m not saying do it illegally, but the sooner you know, the better your \\nchances are for profits with minimal risk. That is what friends are for. \\nAnd that is financial intelligence.\\n4. Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of   \\n learning quickly\\nIn order to make bread, every baker follows a recipe, even if it’s \\nonly held in their head.

For example, if you study cooking, \\nyou then tend to cook. If you don’t want to be a cook anymore, then \\nyou need to study something else. \\nWhen it comes to money, the masses generally have one basic  \\nformula they learned in school and it’s this: Work for money. The  \\npredominant formula I see in the world is that every day millions of \\npeople get up, go to work, earn money, pay bills, balance checkbooks, \\nbuy some mutual funds, and go back to work. That is the basic  \\nformula, or recipe.\\nIf you’re tired of what you’re doing, or you’re not making enough, \\nit’s simply a case of changing the formula via which you make money.\\nYears ago, when I was 26, I took a weekend class called “How to \\nBuy Real Estate Foreclosures.” I learned a formula. The next trick was \\nto have the discipline to actually put into action what I had learned. \\nThat is where most people stop. For three years, while working for  \\nXerox, I spent my spare time learning to master the art of buying  \\nforeclosures. I’ve made several million dollars using that formula.\\nSo after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas. \\nFor many of the classes, I did not directly use the information I learned, \\nbut I always learned something new.\\nI have attended classes designed for derivative traders, commodity  \\noption traders, and chaologists. I was way out of my league, being in a \\nroom full of people with doctorates in nuclear physics and space science. \\nYet, I learned a lot that made my stock and real estate investing more \\nmeaningful and lucrative.\\nMost junior colleges and community colleges have classes on  \\nfinancial planning and buying traditional investments. They are good \\nplaces to start, but I always search for a faster formula. That is why, \\non a fairly regular basis, I make more in a day than many people will \\nmake in their lifetime.\\nAnother side note: In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not so much \\nwhat you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is \\nold. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless. It’s priceless in  \\nfinding faster formulas—recipes, if you will—for making dough.  \\nWorking hard for money is an old formula born in the day of cavemen.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 166}),\n",

It \\nmakes no sense to invest, make money, and blow it. It is the lack of  \\nself-discipline that causes most lottery winners to go broke soon after  \\nwinning millions. It is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who \\nget a raise to immediately go out and buy a new car or take a cruise.\\nIt is difficult to say which of the 10 steps is the most important.  \\nBut of all the steps, this step is probably the most difficult to master \\nif it is not already a part of your makeup. I would venture to say that \\npersonal self-discipline is the number-one delineating factor between \\nthe rich, the poor, and the middle class.\\nSimply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for \\nfinancial pressure can never be rich. As I have said, a lesson learned from \\nmy rich dad was that the world will push you around. The world pushes \\npeople around, not because other people are bullies, but because the \\nindividual lacks internal control and discipline. People who lack internal \\nfortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.\\nIn the entrepreneur classes I teach, I constantly remind people \\nto not focus on their product, service, or widget, but to focus on \\ndeveloping management skills. The three most important management \\nskills necessary to start your own business are management of:\\n1. Cash flow\\n2. People\\n3. Personal time\\nI would say the skills to manage these three apply to anything, not \\njust entrepreneurs. The three matter in the way you live your life as an \\nindividual, or as part of a family, a business, a charitable organization, \\na city, or a nation.\\nEach of these skills is enhanced by the mastery of self-discipline.  \\nI do not take the saying, “Pay yourself first,” lightly.\\nThe statement, “Pay yourself first,” comes from George Clason’s \\nbook, The Richest Man in Babylon.

I still paid myself first. My accountant \\nand bookkeeper screamed in panic, “They’re going to come after you. \\nThe IRS is going to put you in jail.” “You’re going to ruin your credit \\nrating.” “They’ll cut off the electricity.” I still paid myself first.\\n“Why?” you ask. Because that’s what the story, The Richest Man In \\nBabylon,  was all about: the power of self-discipline and the power of \\ninternal fortitude.

A bill  \\ncollector calls and you “pay or else.” A sales clerk says, “Oh, just put it \\non your charge card.” Your real estate agent tells you, “Go ahead.   \\nThe government allows you a tax deduction on your home.” That is \\nwhat the book is really about—having the guts to go against the tide \\nand get rich. You may not be weak, but when it comes to money, \\nmany people get wimpy.\\nI am not saying be irresponsible. The reason I don’t have high  \\ncredit-card debt, and doodad debt, is because I pay myself first. The \\nreason I minimize my income is because I don’t want to pay it to the \\ngovernment. That is why my income comes from my asset column, \\nthrough a Nevada corporation.

Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice \\nSometimes I see people posting a sign in front of their house that  \\nsays, “For Sale by Owner.” Or I see people on TV claiming to be  \\n“Discount Brokers.”\\nMy rich dad taught me to take the opposite approach.

Because if, and I do mean if, the people are  \\nprofessionals, their services should make you money. And the more \\nmoney they make, the more money I make.\\nWe live in the Information Age.

What I find \\nfunny is that so many poor and middle-class people insist on tipping \\nrestaurant help 15 to 20 percent, even for bad service, but complain \\nabout paying a broker three to seven percent.

The same is true for \\nstock, bond, mutual fund, and insurance, brokers who call themselves \\nfinancial planners. \\nWhen I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much  \\nproperty or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in \\ntaxes. And that applies to my tax attorney as well as my accountant.  \\nI have an accountant who minds his own business. His profession is  \\naccounting, but his business is real estate. I used to have an accountant \\nwho was a small-business accountant, but he had no real estate. I \\nswitched because we did not love the same business.\\nFind a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will \\nspend the time educating you, and they could be the best asset you find. \\nJust be fair, and most of them will be fair to you. If all you can think \\nabout is cutting their commissions, then why should they want to help \\nyou? It’s just simple logic.\\nAs I said earlier, one of the management skills is the management \\nof people. Many people only manage people they feel smarter than and \\nthey have power over. Many middle managers remain middle managers, \\nfailing to get promoted, because they know how to work with people \\nbelow them, but not with people above them. The real skill is to manage \\nand reward the people who are smarter than you in some technical area. \\nThat is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one \\ntoo. That is financial intelligence.\\n7. Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing \\nWhen the first European settlers came to America, they were taken \\naback by a cultural practice some American Indians had. For example, if a \\nsettler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it \\nfor a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back.\\nThe Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not \\nwant to give it back. That is where the term “Indian giver” came from,  \\na simple cultural misunderstanding.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Chapter Eight: Getting Started160\\nIn the world of the asset column, being an Indian giver is vital to \\nwealth. The sophisticated investor’s first question is: “How fast do I  \\nget my money back?” They also want to know what they get for free, \\nalso called a “piece of the action.” That is why the ROI, or return on \\ninvestment, is so important.\\nFor example, I found a small condominium that was in foreclosure \\na few blocks from where I lived. The bank wanted $60,000, and I \\nsubmitted a bid for $50,000, which \\nthey took, simply because, along \\nwith my bid, was a cashier’s check for \\n$50,000. They realized I was serious. \\nMost investors would say, “Aren’t you \\ntying up a lot of cash? Would it not be \\nbetter to get a loan on it?” The answer \\nis, “Not in this case.” My investment company uses this condominium \\nas a vacation rental in the winter months when the “snowbirds” \\ncome to Arizona. It rents for $2,500 a month for four months out of \\nthe year. For rental during the off-season, it rents for only $1,000 a \\nmonth. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this \\nasset, which pumps money out for me, month in and month out.\\nThe same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker calls and  \\nrecommends I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a \\ncompany that he feels is just about to make a move that will add value \\nto the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money \\nin for a week to a month while the stock moves up. Then I pull my \\ninitial dollar amount out, and stop worrying about the fluctuations of \\nthe market, because my initial money is back and ready to work on \\nanother asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own \\nan asset that was technically free.\\nT rue, I have lost money on many occasions, but I only play with \\nmoney I can afford to lose. I would say, on an average 10 investments, \\nI hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I \\nlose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in \\nat that time.The sophisticated  \\ninvestor’s first  \\nquestion is: \\n“How fast do I get my \\nmoney back?”', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad161\\nPeople who hate risk put their money in the bank. In the long run, \\nsafe savings are better than no savings. But it takes a long time to get \\nyour money back and, in most instances, you don’t get anything for  \\nfree with it. \\nOn every one of my investments, there must be an upside,  \\nsomething for free—like a condominium, a mini-storage, a piece  \\nof free land, a house, stock shares, or an office building. And there \\nmust be limited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are books devoted \\nentirely to this subject, so I will not talk about it here. Ray Kroc, of \\nMcDonald’s fame, sold hamburger franchises, not because he loved \\nhamburgers, but because he wanted the real estate under the franchise \\nfor free.\\nSo wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at  \\nthe assets they get for free once they get their money back. That is  \\nfinancial intelligence.\\n8. Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus\\nA friend’s child has been developing a nasty habit of burning a \\nhole in his pocket. Just 16, he wanted his own car.

He could use it to find a stockbroker and buy and sell stocks. \\nOnce he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the money would be his \\nfor the car, and the $3,000 would go into his college fund.”\\n“And what are the results?” I asked.\\n“Well, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost everything a few \\ndays later. Then he really got interested. Today, I would say he is down \\n$2,000, but his interest is up. He has read all the books I bought him, \\nand he’s gone to the library to get more. He reads the  Wall Street Journal \\nvoraciously, watching for indicators. He’s got only $1,000 left, but his \\ninterest and learning are sky-high. He knows that if he loses that money, \\nhe walks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems \\nuninterested in getting a car, because he’s found a game that is more fun.”\\n“What happens if he loses all the money?” I asked.\\n“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. I’d rather have him lose \\neverything now than wait till he’s our age to risk losing everything. \\nAnd besides, that is the best $3,000 I’ve ever spent on his education. \\nWhat he is learning will serve him for life, and he seems to have gained \\na new respect for the power of money.” \\nAs I said earlier, if a person cannot master the power of self-  \\ndiscipline, it is best not to try to get rich. I say this because, although  \\nthe process of developing cash flow from an asset column is easy in \\ntheory, what’s hard is the mental fortitude to direct money to the  \\ncorrect use. Due to external temptations, it is much easier in today’s \\nconsumer world to simply blow money out the expense column.  \\nWith weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of  \\nleast resistance.

My rich dad taught me a lesson  \\nI have carried all my life: the necessity of being charitable or giving.  \\nMy educated dad gave a lot of his time and knowledge, but almost  \\nnever gave away money. \\nHe usually said that he would give when he had some extra money, \\nbut of course there was rarely any extra.\\nMy rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly \\nin tithing. “If you want something, you first need to give,” he would \\nalways say. When he was short of money, he gave money to his church \\nor to his favorite charity.\\nIf I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever \\nyou feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and \\nit will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, or \\nfriendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do,  \\nbut it has always worked for me. I trust that the principle of reciprocity \\nis true, and I give what I want. I want money, so I give money, and  \\nit comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help someone else sell  \\nsomething, and sales come to me. I want contacts, and I help \\nsomeone else get contacts. Like magic, contacts come to me. I heard \\na saying years ago that went: “God does not need to receive, but \\nhumans need to give.”\\nMy rich dad would often say, “Poor people are more greedy than \\nrich people.” He would explain that if a person was rich, that person  \\nwas providing something that other people wanted. In my life, \\nwhenever I have felt needy or short of money or short of help, I simply \\nwent out or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it \\nfirst. And when I gave, it always came back. \\nIt reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his \\narms on a cold, freezing night. He is yelling at the pot-bellied stove, \\n“When you give me some heat, then I’ll put some wood in you!” And \\nwhen it comes to money, love, happiness, sales, and contacts, all one \\nneeds to remember is to give first.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 179}),\n",

I think understanding the philosophy \\nis just as important as the action. There are many people who want to do \\ninstead of think, and then there are people who think but do not do. I \\nwould say that I am both. I love new ideas, and I love action.\\nSo for those who want a to-do list on how to get started, I will \\nshare with you some of the things I do, in abbreviated form.\\n•\\tStop doing what you’re doing.  In other words, take a break and   \\nassess what is working and what is not working. The definition  \\nof insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting \\na different result. Stop doing what is not working, and look for  \\nsomething new.\\n•\\tLook for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores \\nand search for books on different and unique subjects. I call \\nthem formulas. I buy how-to books on formulas I know \\nnothing about.\\n For example, in the bookstore I found the book The 16 Percent  \\nSolution   by Joel Moskowitz. I bought the book and read it  \\nand the next Thursday, I did exactly as the book said. Most \\npeople do not take action, or they let someone talk them out  \\nof whatever new formula they are studying. My neighbor told \\nme why 16 percent would not work.

As for  \\n16 percent tax-lien certificates, I went to the county tax office  \\nand found the government employee who worked in that office.  \\nI found out that she, too, invested in the tax liens. Immediately,  \\nI invited her to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything \\nshe knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all \\nafternoon showing me everything. By the next day, I found \\ntwo great properties with her help that have been accruing \\ninterest at 16 percent ever since. It took a day to read the \\nbook, a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to \\nacquire two great deals.\\n•\\tT ake classes, read, and attend seminars.  I search newspapers and  \\nthe Internet for new and interesting classes, many of which are  \\nfree or inexpensive. I also attend and pay for expensive \\nseminars on what I want to learn. I am wealthy and free from \\nneeding a job simply because of the courses I took. I have \\nfriends who did not take those classes who told me I was \\nwasting my money, and yet they’re still at the same job.\\n•\\tMake lots of offers.  When I want a piece of real estate, I look  \\nat many properties and generally write an offer. If you don’t \\nknow what the right offer is, neither do I. That is the job of  \\nthe real estate agent. They make the offers. I do as little work  \\nas possible.\\nA friend wanted me to show her how to buy apartment houses.  \\nSo one Saturday she, her agent, and I went and looked at six \\napartment houses. Four were dogs, but two were good. I said to write \\noffers on all six, offering half of what the owners asked for. She and the \\nagent nearly had heart attacks. They thought it was rude, and would \\noffend the sellers, but I really don’t think the agent wanted to work \\nthat hard. So they did nothing and went on looking for a better deal.\\nNo offers were ever made, and that person is still looking for the right \\ndeal at the right price.

Most sellers ask too much.  \\nIt is rare that a seller asks a price that is less than something is worth.\\nMoral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no \\nidea what it feels like to try to sell something. I have had a piece of real \\nestate that I wanted to sell for months. I would have welcomed any offer. \\nThey could have offered me 10 pigs, and I would have been happy—\\nnot at the offer, but just because someone was interested. I would have \\ncountered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that’s how the game \\nworks. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It’s fun \\nand only a game. Make offers. Someone might say yes.\\nI always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an \\noffer with language that details “subject-to” contingencies, such as the \\napproval of a business partner.  Never specify who the business  \\npartner is. Most people don’t know that my partner is my cat. If they \\naccept the offer, and I don’t want the deal, I call home and speak to \\nmy cat. I make this ridiculous statement to illustrate how absurdly easy \\nand simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and \\ntake it too seriously.\\n•\\tFinding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the \\nright investors, or whatever is just like dating. You must go \\nto the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers, \\ncounteroffers, negotiate, reject, and accept. I know single \\npeople who sit at home and wait for the phone to ring, but it’s \\nbetter to go to the market, even if it’s only the supermarket. \\nSearch, offer, reject, negotiate, and accept are all parts of the \\nprocess of almost everything in life.\\n•\\tJog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for 10 minutes.   \\nI have found some of my best real estate investments doing \\nthis. I will jog a certain neighborhood for a year and look for \\nchange. For there to be profit in a deal, there must be two \\nelements: a bargain and change. There are lots of bargains, but \\nit’s change that turns a bargain into a profitable opportunity. \\nSo when I jog, I jog a neighborhood I might like to invest in. \\nIt is the repetition that causes me to notice slight differences.

       " Document(page_content='173\\nFINAL THOUGHTSI would like to share some final thoughts with you.\\nThe main reason I wrote this book, and the reason it has remained \\na bestseller since 2000, was to share insights into how increased financial \\nintelligence can be used to solve many of life’s common problems. Without \\nfinancial training, we all too often use the standard formulas to get through \\nlife: Work hard, save, borrow, and pay excessive taxes. Today, more than  \\never, we need better information.\\nI use the following story as an example of a financial problem that  \\nconfronts many young families today. How do you afford a good  \\neducation for your children and provide for your own retirement?  \\nIt requires using financial intelligence instead of hard work.\\nA friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to  \\nsave money for his four children’s college educations. He was putting \\n$300 away in a college fund each month and had so far accumulated \\nonly about $12,000. He had about 12 more years to save for college \\nsince his oldest child was then six years old.\\nAt the time, the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People \\nwere giving houses away. I suggested to my friend that he buy a house \\nwith some of the money in his college fund. The idea intrigued him, \\nand we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern was that \\nhe did not have credit with the bank to buy another house since he \\nwas so over-extended. I assured him that there were other ways to \\nfinance a property rather than through the bank.\\nWe looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all our \\ncriteria. There were plenty to choose from so shopping was fun. Finally, \\nwe found a three-bedroom, two-bath home in a prime neighborhood. \\nThe owner had been downsized and needed to sell that day because he ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 187}),\n",

He took \\nit immediately and agreed to carry back the loan with a 10 percent \\ndown payment. All my friend had to come up with was $7,900. As \\nsoon as the owner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all \\nexpenses were paid, including the mortgage, he put about $125 in his \\npocket each month.\\nHis plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage \\nget paid down faster by applying the extra $125 to the principal each \\nmonth. We figured that in 12 years, a large portion of the mortgage \\nwould be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by \\nthe time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it \\nhad appreciated in value.\\nThree years later, the real estate market greatly improved in \\nPhoenix and he was offered $156,000 for the same house by the \\ntenant who lived in it. Again, he asked me what I thought. I advised \\nthat he sell it, using a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.\\nSuddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another \\nfriend in Austin, Texas, who then moved this tax-deferred capital gain \\ninto a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began receiving \\nchecks for a little less than a $1,000 a month which he then poured \\nback into the college fund. \\nA couple of years later, the mini-warehouse sold, and he received \\na check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale. He rolled those \\nfunds into a new project that would now generate over $3,000 a \\nmonth in income, again, going into the college fund. He is now very \\nconfident that his goal will be met easily. \\nIt only took $7,900 to start and a little financial intelligence. His \\nchildren will be able to afford the education they want, and he will \\nthen use the underlying asset, wrapped in his legal entity, to pay for his \\nretirement. As a result of this successful investment strategy, he will be \\nable to retire early.\\nThank you for reading this book.

Every self-made person started small with an idea, and \\nthen turned it into something big. The same applies to investing. It \\ntakes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big.

My rich dad also thought \\na good education was important. But to him it was also important \\nthat Mike and I know the differences in the three incomes and what \\nkind of income to work hard for.

Fourteen \\nyears ago, Robert Kiyosaki challenged conventional wisdom with his \\nbold statement that “your house is not an asset.” His contrarian views on \\nmoney and investing were met with skepticism, criticism, and outrage.\\nIn 2002, Robert’s book, Rich Dad’s Prophecy,  advised that we prepare for \\nan upcoming financial market crash. In 2006, Robert joined forces with \\nDonald T rump to write Why We Want You To Be Rich,  a book inspired by \\ntheir concern for the shrinking middle class in America. \\nRobert continues to be a passionate advocate for the importance and \\npower of financial education. Today, in the wake of the subprime fiasco, \\nrecord home foreclosures, and a global economic meltdown that is \\nstill raging, his words seem not only prophetic, but enlightened. Many \\nskeptics have become believers. \\nIn preparing the 2011 edition of Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant,  \\nRobert realized two things: that his message and teachings have withstood \\nthe test of time, and that the investment landscape, the world in which \\ninvestors operate, has changed dramatically. These changes have affected, \\nand will continue to affect, those in the I (Investor) quadrant and have \\nfueled Robert’s decision to update an important section in this book—\\nChapter Five: The Five Levels of Investors.\\nix', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 209}),\n",

If it \\nsounded exciting and glamorous, I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a \\nmarine biologist, an astronaut, a Marine, a ship’s officer, a pilot, and  \\na professional football player. \\nI was fortunate enough to achieve three of those goals: a Marine \\nCorps officer, a ship’s officer, and a pilot.\\nI knew I did not want to become a teacher, a writer, or an accountant.  \\nI did not want to be a teacher because I did not like school. I did not want \\nto be a writer because I failed English twice. And I dropped out of my \\nMBA program because I could not stand accounting.\\nIronically, now that I have grown up, I have become everything  \\nI never wanted to become. Although I disliked school, today I own an \\neducation company. I personally teach around the world because I love \\nteaching. Although I failed English twice because I could not write, \\ntoday I am best known as an author. My book, Rich Dad Poor Dad,  was \\non the New York Times best-sellers list for over seven years and is one of \\nthe top three best-selling books in the United States. The only books \\nahead of it are The Joy of Sex  and The Road Less Traveled.

       " Document(page_content='The answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by \\na Vietnamese monk, Thich Naht Hahn: “The path is the goal.” In \\nother words, finding your path in life is your goal in life. Your path is \\nnot your profession, how much money you make, your title, or your \\nsuccesses and failures. \\nFinding your path means finding out what you were put here on \\nthis earth to do. What is your life’s purpose?  Why were you given this \\ngift called life? And what is the gift you give back to life?\\nLooking back, I know going to school was not about finding my \\nlife’s path. I spent four years in military school, studying and training \\nto be a ship’s officer. If I had made a career sailing for Standard Oil \\non their oil tankers, I would never have found my life’s path. If I had \\nstayed in the Marines or had gone to fly for the airlines, I would never \\nhave found my life’s path. \\nHad I continued on as a ship’s officer or become an airline pilot, \\nI would never have become an international best-selling author, \\nbeen a guest on the Oprah  show, written a book with Donald \\nT rump, or started an international education company that teaches \\nentrepreneurship and investing throughout the world. \\nFinding Your Path\\nThis CASHFLOW  Quadrant  book is important because it is about \\nfinding your path in life. As you know, most people are programmed \\nearly in life to “Go to school and get a job.” School is about finding a \\njob in the E or S quadrant. It is not about finding your life’s path.\\nI realize there are people who know exactly what they are going to \\ndo early in life. They grow up knowing they are going to be a doctor, \\nlawyer, musician, golfer or actor. We have all heard about child \\nprodigies, kids with exceptional talents.

If I could wave my magic wand and \\nyour life’s path would magically appear, I would.\\nSince I do not have a magic wand nor can I tell you what to do, \\nthe best thing I can do is tell you what I did. And what I did was trust \\nmy intuition, my heart, and my guts. For example, in 1973, returning \\nfrom the war, when my poor dad suggested I go back to school, get my \\nhigher degrees, and work for the government, my brain went numb, \\nmy heart went heavy and my gut said, “No way.”  \\nWhen he suggested I get my old job back with Standard Oil or fly \\nfor the airlines, again my mind, heart, and gut said no. I knew I was \\nthrough sailing and flying, although they were great professions and \\nthe pay was pretty good. \\nIn 1973 at the age of 26, I was growing up. I had followed my \\nparent’s advice and gone to school, received my college degree, and had \\ntwo professions: a license to be a ship’s officer and a license to fly. The \\nproblem was, they were professions and the dreams of a child.\\nAt the age of 26, I was old enough to know that education is a process. \\nFor example, when I wanted to be a ship’s officer, I went to a school that \\nturned out ships’ officers. And when I wanted to learn to fly, I went to \\nNavy flight school, a two-year process that turns non-pilots into pilots.  \\nI was cautious about my next educational process. I wanted to know what \\nI was going to become before I started my next educational process.\\nT raditional schools had been good to me. I had achieved my \\nchildhood professions. Reaching adulthood was confusing because \\nthere were no signs saying, “This is the way.” I knew what I didn’t  want \\nto do, but I did not know what I wanted  to do.\\nIt would have been simple if all I wanted was a new profession.  \\nIf I had wanted to be a medical doctor, I would have gone to medical \\nschool. If I had wanted to be a lawyer, I would have gone to law \\nschool. But I knew there was more to life than just going to school to \\ngain another professional credential. \\nI did not realize it at the time, but at 26 years of age, I was now \\nlooking for my path in life, not my next profession.CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nxvii', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 215}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A Different Education\\nIn 1973, in my last year of active duty flying for the Marine \\nCorps when I was stationed near home in Hawaii, I knew I wanted \\nto follow in my rich dad’s footsteps. While in the Marines, I signed \\nup for real estate courses and business courses on the weekends, \\npreparing to become an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants. \\nAt the same time, upon a friend’s recommendation of a friend, \\nI signed up for a personal-development course, hoping to find out \\nwho I really was. A personal-development course is non-traditional \\neducation because I was not taking it for credits or grades. I did not \\nknow what I was going to learn, as I did when I signed up for real \\nestate courses. All I knew was that it was time to take courses to find \\nout about me.\\nIn my first weekend course, the instructor drew this simple \\ndiagram on the flip chart:\\nSPIRITUALEMOTIONALMENTALPHYSICALPreface\\nxviii', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 216}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='With the diagram complete, the instructor turned and said, \\n“To develop into a whole human being, we need mental, physical, \\nemotional, and spiritual education.”\\nListening to her explanation, it was clear to me that traditional schools \\nwere primarily about developing students mentally. That is why so many \\nstudents who do well in school, do not do well in real life, especially in the \\nworld of money.\\nAs the course progressed over the weekend, I discovered why I disliked \\nschool. I realized that I loved learning, but hated school.\\nT raditional education was a great environment for the “A” \\nstudents, but it was not the environment for me. T raditional education \\nwas crushing my spirit, trying to motivate me with the emotion of \\nfear: the fear of making mistakes, the fear of failing, and the fear of not \\ngetting a job. They were programming me to be an employee in the E \\nor S quadrant. I realized that traditional education is not the place for \\na person who wants to be an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants.\\nThis may be why so many entrepreneurs never finish school—\\nentrepreneurs like Thomas Edison, founder of General Electric; Henry \\nFord, founder of Ford Motor Company; Steve Jobs, founder of Apple; \\nBill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Walt Disney, founder of Disneyland; \\nand Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.\\nAs the day went on and the instructor went deeper and deeper into \\nthese four types of personal development, I realized I had spent most \\nof my life in very harsh educational environments. After four years at \\nan all-male military academy and five years as a Marine pilot, I was \\npretty strong mentally and physically. As a Marine pilot, I was strong \\nemotionally and spiritually, but all on the macho-male development \\nside. I had no gentle side, no female energy. After all, I was trained to \\nbe Marine Corps officer, emotionally calm under pressure, prepared to \\nkill, and spiritually prepared to die for my country.\\nIf you ever saw the movie Top Gun  starring Tom Cruise, you get \\na glimpse into the masculine world and bravado of military pilots.

The seminar had been a gentle, loving, honest environment. \\nMonday morning was a shock to once again be surrounded by young \\negotistical pilots, dedicated to flying, killing and dying for country.\\nAfter that weekend seminar, I knew it was time to change. I knew \\ndeveloping myself emotionally and spiritually to become a kinder, \\ngentler, and more compassionate person would be the hardest thing \\nI could do. It went against all my years at the military academy and \\nflight school.\\nI never returned to traditional education again. I had no desire \\nto study for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From \\nthen on, if I did attend a course or school, I went to learn, to become \\na better person. I was no longer in the paper chase of grades, degrees, \\nand credentials. \\nGrowing up in a family of teachers, your grades, the high school \\nand college you graduated from, and your advanced degrees were \\neverything.

Once that seminar was over, I became a seminar junkie, going \\nfrom seminar to seminar, finding out more about the connection \\nbetween my body, my mind, my emotions, and my spirit.\\nThe more I studied, the more curious about traditional education  \\nI became.

Rather than sail for \\nthe rest of his life, he went to law school after graduation, spending \\nthree more years becoming a lawyer and entering private practice in \\nthe S quadrant. \\nHe died in his early fifties. He had become a very successful, \\nunhappy lawyer. Like me, he had two professions by the time he was \\n26. Although he hated being a lawyer, he continued being a lawyer \\nbecause he had a family, kids, a mortgage, and bills to pay. \\nA year before he died, I met him at a class reunion in New York. \\nHe was a bitter man. “All I do is sweep up behind rich guys like you. \\nThey pay me nothing. I hate what I do and who I work for.”\\n“Why don’t you do something else?” I asked.\\n“I can’t afford to stop working. My first child is entering college.”\\nHe died of a heart attack before she graduated. \\nHe made a lot of money via his professional training, but he was \\nemotionally angry, spiritually dead, and soon his body followed.\\nI realize this is an extreme example. Most people do not hate what \\nthey do as much as my friend did. Yet it illustrates the problem when \\na person is trapped in a profession and unable to find their path. \\nTo me, this is the shortcoming of traditional education. Millions \\nof people leave school, only to be trapped in jobs they do not like. \\nThey know something is missing in life. Many people are also trapped \\nfinancially, earning just enough to survive, wanting to earn more but \\nnot knowing what to do.\\nWithout awareness of the other quadrants, many people go back \\nto school and look for new professions or pay raises in the E or S \\nquadrant, unaware of the world of the B and I quadrants.Preface\\nxxii', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 220}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='My Reason for Becoming a T eacher\\nMy primary reason for becoming a teacher in the B quadrant was a \\ndesire to provide financial education. I wanted to make this education \\navailable to anyone who wanted to learn, regardless of how much money \\nthey had or what their grade-point averages were. That is why The Rich \\nDad Company started with the CASHFLOW  game. This game can teach \\nin places I could never go. The beauty of the game is that it was designed \\nto have people teach people. There is no need for an expensive teacher \\nor classroom. The CASHFLOW  game is now translated into over sixteen \\nlanguages, reaching millions of people all over the world.\\nToday, The Rich Dad Company offers financial-education courses as \\nwell as the services of coaches and mentors to support a person’s financial \\neducation. Our programs are especially important for anyone wanting to \\nevolve out of the E and S quadrants into the B and I quadrants.\\nThere is no guarantee that everyone will make it to the B and I \\nquadrants, yet they will know how to access those quadrants if they want to.\\nChange Is Not Easy\\nFor me, changing quadrants was not easy. It was hard work \\nmentally, but more so emotionally and spiritually. Growing up in a \\nfamily of highly educated employees in the E quadrant, I carried their \\nvalues of education, job security, benefits, and a government pension. \\nIn many ways, my family values made my transition difficult. I had to \\nshut out their warnings, concerns, and criticisms about becoming an \\nentrepreneur and investor. Some of their values I had to discount were:\\n•\\t“But you have to have a job.”\\n•\\t“You’re taking too many risks.”\\n•\\t“What if you fail?”\\n•\\t“Just go back to school and get your masters degree.”\\n•\\t“Become a doctor. They make a lot of money.”\\n•\\t“The rich are greedy.”CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nxxiii', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 221}),\n",

Don’t go for your dreams.”\\nDiet and Exercise\\nI mention emotional and spiritual development because that is \\nwhat it takes to make a permanent change in life. For example, it \\nrarely works to tell an overweight person, “Just eat less and exercise \\nmore.” Diet and exercise may make sense mentally, but most people \\nwho are overweight do not eat because they are hungry. They eat to \\nfeed an emptiness in their emotions and their soul. When a person \\ngoes on a diet-and-exercise program, they are only working on their \\nmind and their body. Without emotional development and spiritual \\nstrength, the overweight person may go on a diet for six months  \\nand lose a ton of weight, only to put even more weight back on later.\\nThe same is true for changing quadrants. Saying to yourself,  \\n“I’m going to become an entrepreneur in the B quadrant,” is as futile \\nas a chain smoker saying, “Tomorrow I’m going to quit smoking.” \\nSmoking is a physical addiction caused by emotional and spiritual \\nchallenges. Without emotional and spiritual support, the smoker  \\nwill always be a smoker. The same is true for an alcoholic, a sex \\naddict, or a chronic shopper. Most addictions are attempts to find \\nhappiness in people’s souls.\\nThis is why my company offers courses for the mind and body, \\nbut also coaches and mentors to support the emotional and spiritual \\ntransitions.\\nA few people are able to make the journey alone, but I was not \\none of them. If not for a coach like my rich dad and the support  \\nof my wife Kim, I would not have made it. There were so many  \\ntimes I wanted to quit and give up.

That is why so many “A” students get stuck in “analysis \\nparalysis,” studying every little detail, but failing to do anything.\\nThis “analysis paralysis” is caused by our educational system \\npunishing students for making mistakes. If you think about it, \\n“A” students are “A” students simply because they made the fewest \\nmistakes. The problem with that emotional psychosis is that, in the \\nreal world, people who take action are the ones who make the most \\nmistakes and learn from them to win in the game of life.\\nJust look at Presidents Clinton and Bush.

Introduction\\nRICH DAD POOR DAD1\\nI had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly \\neducated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years \\nof undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to \\nStanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern \\nUniversity to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. \\nThe other father never finished the eighth grade.\\nBoth men were successful in their careers, working hard all their \\nlives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled \\nfinancially. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. \\nOne died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and \\nhis church. The other left bills to be paid.\\nBoth men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men \\noffered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men \\nbelieved strongly in education but did not recommend the same course \\nof study.\\nIf I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his \\nadvice. Having two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points \\nof view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man.\\nInstead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found \\nmyself thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself. The \\nproblem was that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Introduction2\\nwas not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and \\nboth were struggling with money and families. But they had very \\ndifferent points of view about money.\\nFor example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root \\nof all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”\\nAs a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me \\nwas difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers \\ndid not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, \\nparticularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and \\nintrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about \\nwhat each was saying.\\nMuch of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself \\nquestions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same \\nquestion of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much \\neasier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply \\nreject the point of view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what \\nhe’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced \\nme to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a \\nprocess, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in \\nthe long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.\\nOne of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and \\nthe middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is \\ntaught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from \\nour parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? \\nThey simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may \\ngraduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person’s financial \\nprogramming and mindset.\\nSadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic \\nand professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how \\nsmart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades \\nmay struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt \\nis due in large part to highly educated politicians and government \\nofficials making financial decisions with little or no training in the  \\nsubject of money.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad3\\nToday I often wonder what will soon happen when we have \\nmillions of people who need financial and medical assistance. They \\nwill be dependent upon their families or the government for financial \\nsupport. What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run  \\nout of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about \\nmoney continues to be left to parents—most of whom will be, or \\nalready are, poor?\\nBecause I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of \\nthem. I had to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I \\ngained valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on \\none’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford \\nit.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask,  \\n“How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. \\nOne lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My  \\nsoon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the \\nwords “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the \\nquestion “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He did  \\nnot mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical \\nabout exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the  \\nworld. He’d say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise  \\nit. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that \\nautomatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.\\nAlthough both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a \\nhabit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the \\nother had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was \\nthat one dad grew stronger financially, and the other grew weaker. It \\nis not much different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise \\non a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching \\ntelevision. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, \\nand proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. \\nMy two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way \\nthey thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in \\ntaxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes \\npunish those who produce and reward those who don’t produce.” ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Introduction4\\nOne dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good \\ncompany to work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you \\ncan find a good company to buy.”\\nOne dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you \\nkids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have  \\nyou kids.”\\nOne encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner \\ntable, while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed \\nover a meal.\\nOne said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take \\nrisks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.”\\nOne believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our  \\ngreatest asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your \\nhouse is your largest investment, you’re in trouble.”\\nBoth dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while \\nthe other paid his bills last.\\nOne dad believed in a company or the government taking care \\nof you and your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises, \\nretirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and \\nother perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the \\nmilitary and earned a retirement-and-entitlement package for life  \\nafter twenty years of active service. He loved the idea of medical \\nbenefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also \\nloved the tenure system available through the university. The idea  \\nof job protection for life and job benefits seemed more important, \\nat times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve worked hard for the \\ngovernment, and I’m entitled to these benefits.”\\nThe other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out \\nagainst the entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially \\nneedy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.\\nOne dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created \\ninvestments. One dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé \\nso I could find a good job. The other taught me how to write strong \\nbusiness and financial plans so I could create jobs.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad5\\nBeing a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of \\nobserving the effects different thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed \\nthat people really do shape their lives through their thoughts.\\nFor example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And \\nthat prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always \\nreferred to himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, \\nand rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a \\nmajor financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. \\nHe would cover himself by saying, “There is a difference between \\nbeing poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.”\\nMy poor dad would say, “I’m not interested in money,” or  \\n“Money doesn’t matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.”\\nThe power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, \\nbut it became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important \\nto be aware of my thoughts and how \\nI expressed myself. I noticed that my \\npoor dad was poor, not because of the \\namount of money he earned, which was \\nsignificant, but because of his thoughts \\nand actions. As a young boy having two \\nfathers, I became acutely aware of being \\ncareful about which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. Should I \\nlisten to my rich dad or to my poor dad?\\nAlthough both men had tremendous respect for education and \\nlearning, they disagreed about what they thought was important to \\nlearn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job \\nto earn money. He wanted me to study to become a professional, an \\nattorney or an accountant, and to go to business school for my MBA. \\nThe other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how \\nmoney works, and to learn how to have it work for me. “I don’t work \\nfor money!” were words he would repeat over and over. “Money works \\nfor me!”\\nAt the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich \\ndad about money. In doing so, I chose not to listen to my poor dad,  \\neven though he was the one with all the college degrees.There is a difference \\nbetween being poor  \\nand being broke.  \\nBroke is temporary.  \\nPoor is eternal.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Introduction6\\nA Lesson from Robert Frost\\nRobert Frost is my favorite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my \\nfavorite is “The Road Not Taken.” I use its lesson almost daily.\\nThe Road Not Taken\\nT wo roads diverged in a yellow wood,  \\nAnd sorry I could not travel both  \\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood  \\nAnd looked down one as far as I could  \\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;  \\nThen took the other, as just as fair,  \\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,  \\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear  \\nThough as for that the passing there  \\nHad worn them really about the same,  \\nAnd both that morning equally lay  \\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.  \\nOh, I kept the first for another day!  \\nYet knowing how way leads onto way,  \\nI doubted if I should ever come back.  \\nI shall be telling this with a sigh  \\nSomewhere ages and ages hence;  \\nT wo roads diverged in a wood, and I—  \\nI took the one less traveled by,  \\nAnd that has made all the difference.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad7\\nAnd that has made all the difference.\\nOver the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost’s poem. \\nChoosing not to listen to my highly educated dad’s advice and attitude \\nabout money was a painful decision, but it was a decision that shaped \\nthe rest of my life.\\nOnce I made up my mind about whom to listen to, my education \\nabout money began. My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years \\nuntil I was 39 years old. He stopped once he realized that I knew and fully \\nunderstood what he had been trying to drum into my often-thick skull.\\nMoney is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial \\neducation. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about \\nhow money works, you gain power over it and can begin building \\nwealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because \\nmost people went to school and never learned how money works, so \\nthey spend their lives working for money.\\nBecause I was only nine years old when I started, the lessons my rich \\ndad taught me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there \\nwere only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is about \\nthose six lessons, put as simply as possible, just as simply as my rich dad \\nput forth those lessons to me. The lessons are meant not to be answers, \\nbut guideposts that will assist you and your children to grow wealthier \\nno matter what happens in a world of increasing change and uncertainty.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

He took three \\nof his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited.

I stood waiting for an answer.\\nThe year was 1956. I was nine years old. By some twist of fate, \\nI attended the same public school where the rich people sent their \\nkids. We were primarily a sugar-plantation town. The managers of \\nthe plantation and the other affluent people, such as doctors, business \\nowners, and bankers, sent their children to this elementary school. \\nAfter grade six, their children were generally sent off to private \\nschools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went \\nto this school.

After grade six, these kids and I would go on to the public \\nintermediate and high school. There was no private school for them \\nor for me.\\nMy dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.\\n“Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have \\nto learn to make money.”\\n“How do I make money?” I asked.\\n“Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew \\nthat really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know \\nthe answer, so don’t embarrass me.”\\n \\nA Partnership Is Formed\\nThe next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had \\nsaid. As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this \\nschool. Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had \\ndrawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in  \\nschool with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we  \\nwere because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, \\nnew everything.\\nMom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter,  \\nand clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want \\nsomething, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much \\nwork available for nine-year-old boys.\\n“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.\\n“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”\\nHe agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my \\nfirst business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas \\non how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool \\nguys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt \\nwas good, because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make \\nmoney. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an \\nidea Mike got from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook \\nhands, and the partnership now had a business.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad11\\nFor the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, \\nknocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their \\ntoothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a \\nsmile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t \\ntell you. It’s a business secret.”\\nMy mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a \\nsite next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our \\nraw materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup \\nbottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.\\nFinally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’ \\nmessy, crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you \\nboys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business \\nsecret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”\\nMike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon \\nhave enough and then we would begin production. We informed her \\nthat we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste \\nso we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.\\nThe date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was \\non. My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction \\nnotice by my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to \\nquickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to \\nbrush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.\\nOne day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old \\nboys in the driveway with a production line operating at full speed. \\nThere was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table were small \\nmilk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing \\nwith red-hot coals at maximum heat.\\nDad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of \\nthe driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and \\nhis friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in \\nwhich the toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days, \\ntoothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of \\nlead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the \\nsmall steel pot. They melted until they became liquid, and with my ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

White powder \\nwas everywhere. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the \\nentire area looked like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk \\ncartons were the outer containers for plaster of paris molds.\\nMy dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten \\nlead through a small hole in the top of the plaster of paris cube.\\n“Careful,” my dad said.\\nI nodded without looking up.\\nFinally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down \\nand smiled at my dad.\\n“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile.\\n“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,”  \\nI said.\\n“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.”\\n“And what is in those plaster molds?” my dad asked.\\n“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.”\\nWith a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube \\nin half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a \\nlead nickel fell out.\\n“Oh, no!” my dad exclaimed. “You’re casting nickels out of lead!”\\n“That’s right,” Mike said. “We’re doing as you told us to do. We’re  \\nmaking money.”\\nMy dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled \\nand shook his head. Along with a fire and a box of spent toothpaste \\ntubes, in front of him were two little boys covered with white dust \\nsmiling from ear to ear.\\nHe asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front  \\nstep of our house. With a smile, he gently explained what the word \\n“counterfeiting” meant.\\nOur dreams were dashed. “You mean this is illegal?” asked Mike \\nin a quivering voice.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",

Keep going. I’m really proud  \\nof you!”\\nDisappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes \\nbefore we began cleaning up our mess. The business was over on \\nopening day. Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike and said,  \\n“I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. We are poor.”\\nMy father was just leaving as I said that. “Boys,” he said. “You’re \\nonly poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did \\nsomething. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You’ve \\ndone something. I’m very proud of the two of you. I will say it again: \\nKeep going. Don’t quit.”\\nMike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we  \\nstill did not know what to do.\\n“So how come you’re not rich, Dad?” I asked.\\n“Because I chose to be a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers really don’t \\nthink about being rich. We just like to teach. I wish I could help you, \\nbut I really don’t know how to make money.”\\nMike and I turned and continued our cleanup.\\n“I know,” said my dad. “If you boys want to learn how to be  \\nrich, don’t ask me. Talk to your dad, Mike.”\\n“My dad?” asked Mike with a scrunched-up face.\\n“Yeah, your dad,” repeated my dad with a smile. “Your dad  \\nand I have the same banker, and he raves about your father. He’s  \\ntold me several times that your father is brilliant when it comes to  \\nmaking money.”\\n“My dad?” Mike asked again in disbelief. “Then how come we \\ndon’t have a nice car and a nice house like the rich kids at school?”\\n“A nice car and a nice house don’t necessarily mean you’re rich or \\nyou know how to make money,” my dad replied. “Jimmy’s dad works for ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

He seems to be building \\nan empire, and I suspect in a few years he will be a very rich man.”\\nWith that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began \\ncleaning up the mess caused by our now-defunct first business. As we \\nwere cleaning, we made plans for how and when to talk to Mike’s dad. \\nThe problem was that Mike’s dad worked long hours and often did not \\ncome home until late. His father owned warehouses, a construction \\ncompany, a chain of stores, and three restaurants. It was the restaurants \\nthat kept him out late.\\nMike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up.

On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the \\nroad and parking lot. Every time a car drove by or pulled into the \\nparking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store. We knew we had  \\na job as long as there was no air-conditioning.\\nFor three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked \\nour three hours. By noon, our work was over, and she dropped three little \\ndimes in each of our hands. Now, even at the age of nine in the mid-\\n1950s, 30 cents was not too exciting.

I’ve worked for you, and you have not \\nkept your word. You haven’t taught me anything.”\\n“How do you know that I’ve not taught you anything?” asked rich  \\ndad calmly.\\n“Well, you’ve never talked to me.

If you don’t, you will spend your  \\nlife blaming a job, low pay, or your boss for your problems. You’ll  \\nlive life always hoping for that big break that will solve all your  \\nmoney problems.”\\nRich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes \\nmet mine. We stared at each other, communicating through our eyes. \\nFinally, I looked away once I had absorbed his message. I knew he \\nwas right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn.

I have more than 150 employees, and not \\none of them has asked me what I know about money. They ask me for \\na job and a paycheck, but never to teach them about money.

That’s why I only \\npaid you 10 cents.”\\n“So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an \\nhour?” I asked. “That you’re cheap and exploit your workers?”\\nRich dad rocked back and laughed heartily. Finally he said, \\n“You’d best change your point of view. Stop blaming me and thinking \\nI’m the problem. If you think I’m the problem, then you have to \\nchange me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can \\nchange yourself, learn something, and grow wiser. Most people want \\neveryone else in the world to change but themselves. Let me tell you, \\nit’s easier to change yourself than everyone else.”\\n“I don’t understand,” I said.\\n“Don’t blame me for your problems,” rich dad said, growing impatient.\\n“But you only pay me 10 cents.”\\n“So what are you learning?” rich dad asked, smiling.\\n“That you’re cheap,” I said with a sly grin.\\n“See, you think I’m the problem,” said rich dad.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 35}),\n",

They quit and go looking for another job, a better opportunity, \\nand higher pay, actually thinking that this will solve the problem. In \\nmost cases, it won’t.”\\n“So what should I do?” I asked. “Just take this measly 10 cents an \\nhour and smile?”\\nRich dad smiled. “That’s what the other people do.

The \\nrich have money work for them.\\nOn that bright Saturday morning, I learned a completely different \\npoint of view from what I had been taught by my poor dad.

And make sure it has excellent \\nbenefits.” My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I \\ncould make it work for me.\\nThese lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not \\nbecause of a classroom.\\nMy rich dad continued my first lesson, “I’m glad you got angry \\nabout working for 10 cents an hour. If you hadn’t got angry and had \\nsimply accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you. \\nYou see, true learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger \\nis a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. \\nWhen it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel \\nsecure. So passion does not direct them. Fear does.”\\n“So is that why they’ll take jobs with low pay?” I asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people because  \\nI don’t pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government. I  \\nsay the people exploit themselves. It’s their fear, not mine.”\\n“But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked.\\n“I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve their \\nproblems. Just look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he  \\nstill can’t pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get into \\nmore debt.”\\n“So that’s why the 10 cents an hour,” I said, smiling. “It’s a part  \\nof the lesson.”\\n“That’s right,” smiled rich dad. “You see, your dad went to school \\nand got an excellent education, so he could get a high-paying job. But \\nhe still has money problems because he never learned anything about \\nmoney in school. On top of that, he believes in working for money.”\\n“And you don’t?” I asked.\\n“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to work for \\nmoney, then stay in school.

He understood that every \\nperson has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought, \\nand he knew that every individual also had a part of their soul that \\nwas resilient and could never be bought. It was only a question of \\nwhich one was stronger. \\n“Okay, five dollars an hour.”\\nSuddenly I was silent. Something had changed. The offer was too \\nbig and ridiculous. Not many grown-ups in 1956 made more than \\nthat, but quickly my temptation disappeared, and calm set in. Slowly, \\nI turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part \\nof my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that \\nhad no price took over. I knew Mike \\nhad gotten to that point too.\\n“Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most \\npeople have a price. And they have a \\nprice because of human emotions named \\nfear and greed. First, the fear of being \\nwithout money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that \\npaycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful \\nthings money can buy. The pattern is then set.”\\n“What pattern?” I asked.\\n“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work, \\npay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear \\nand greed. Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by \\nincreasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.” \\n“There is another way?” Mike asked.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad slowly. “But only a few people find it.” \\n“And what is that way?” Mike asked.\\n“That’s what I hope you boys will learn as you work and study  \\nwith me. That is why I took away all forms of pay.”\\n“Any hints?” Mike asked. “We’re kind of tired of working hard, \\nespecially for nothing.”\\n“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad.\\n“We haven’t been lying,” I said.People’s lives are  \\nforever controlled  \\nby two emotions:  \\nfear and greed.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",

I said to tell the truth,” rich  \\ndad retorted.\\n“The truth about what?” I asked.\\n“How you’re feeling,” rich dad said. “You don’t have to say it  \\nto anyone else. Just admit it to yourself.”\\n“You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you, \\nMrs. Martin, they don’t do that?” I asked.\\n“I doubt it,” said rich dad. “Instead, they feel the fear of not \\nhaving money. They don’t confront it logically. They react emotionally \\ninstead of using their heads,” rich dad said. “Then, they get a few \\nbucks in their hands and again, the emotions of joy, desire, and greed \\ntake over. And again they react, instead of think.”\\n“So their emotions control their brain,” Mike said.\\n“That’s correct,” said rich dad. “Instead of admitting the truth \\nabout how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think. \\nThey feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe \\nthe fear, but it doesn’t. It continues to haunt them and they return \\nto work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it \\ndoesn’t. Fear keeps them in this trap of working, earning money,  \\nworking, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day \\nthey get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of \\npeople that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of \\nturmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a  \\npaycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running \\ntheir lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in \\ncontrol of their emotions and their souls.”\\nRich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard \\nwhat he said but didn’t understand fully what he was talking about.  \\nI just knew that I often wondered why grown-ups hurried off to \\nwork. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that \\nhappy, but something kept them going.\\nRealizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was \\ntalking about, rich dad said, “I want you boys to avoid that trap.  \\nThat is really what I want to teach you.

It’s perfectly normal to desire something \\nbetter, prettier, more fun, or exciting. So people also work for money \\nbecause of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. \\nBut the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need \\nmore money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more \\nsecurity. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls \\nthat are troubled by fear and desire. But money can’t do that.”\\n“Even rich people do this?” Mike asked.\\n“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich \\npeople are rich isn’t because of desire, but because of fear. They believe \\nthat money can eliminate the fear of being poor, so they amass tons of it, \\nonly to find the fear gets worse. Now they fear losing the money. I have \\nfriends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people \\nwho have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. \\nThey’re terrified of losing it all. The fears that drove them to get rich \\ngot worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming \\nlouder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life \\nmoney has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say \\nif they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, \\nalthough they look rich and have more money.”\\n“So is a poor man happier?” I asked.\\n“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money \\nis just as psychotic as being attached to money.”\\nAs if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by \\nthe large rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us \\nwatched him with great interest, when before we probably would \\nhave just ignored him.\\nRich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the \\nolder man. Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately, \\ntook the bill, thanked rich dad profusely, and hurried off, ecstatic \\nwith his good fortune.\\n“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich \\ndad. “I’ve met so many people who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 45}),\n",

If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working? \\nThat kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who \\nhoards money.” \\nAs I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind flashed back to \\nthe countless times my own dad said, “I’m not interested in money.” \\nHe said those words often. He also \\ncovered himself by always saying,  \\n“I work because I love my job.”\\n“So what do we do?” I asked. “Not \\nwork for money until all traces of fear \\nand greed are gone?”\\n“No, that would be a waste of time,” \\nsaid rich dad. “Emotions are what make \\nus human. The word ‘emotion’ stands for ‘energy in motion.’ Be \\ntruthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in \\nyour favor, not against yourself.”\\n“Whoa!” said Mike.\\n“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in \\nyears to come. Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. \\nMost people do not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the \\nthinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn \\nto do your own thinking.”\\n“Can you give me an example?” I asked.\\n“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, ‘I need to find \\na job,’ it’s most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not \\nhaving money generates that thought.”\\n“But people do need money if they have bills to pay,” I said.\\n“Sure they do,” smiled rich dad. “All I’m saying is that it’s fear that \\nis all too often doing the thinking.”\\n“I don’t understand,” said Mike.\\n“For example,” said rich dad. “If the fear of not having enough \\nmoney arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job, they \\ninstead might ask themselves this question: ‘Will a job be the best  So many people say,  \\n“Oh, I’m not  \\ninterested in money.”  \\nYet they’ll work  \\nat a job for  \\neight hours a day.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 46}),\n",

A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem.”\\n“But my dad is always saying, ‘Stay in school and get good grades, \\nso you can find a safe, secure job,’” I interjected, somewhat confused. \\n“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people \\nrecommend that, and it’s a good path for most people. But people make \\nthat recommendation primarily out of fear.”\\n“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?”\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t earn enough \\nmoney and won’t fit into society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you \\nand wants the best for you. I too believe an education and a job are \\nimportant, but it won’t handle the fear. You see, that same fear that \\nmakes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that  \\nis causing him to be so fanatical about your going to school.”\\n“So what do you recommend?” I asked.\\n“I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of  \\nbeing afraid of it. They don’t teach that in school and, if you don’t  \\nlearn it, you become a slave to money.”\\nIt was finally making sense. He wanted us to widen our views  \\nand to see what the Mrs. Martins of this world couldn’t see. He used \\nexamples that sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten \\nthem. My vision widened that day, and I began to see the trap that  \\nlay ahead for most people.\\n“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different \\nlevels,” said rich dad. “I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid \\nthe trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in \\nyour favor, not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not \\ninterested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t \\nhandle the fear or desire. If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and \\nyou get rich, you’ll only be a highly paid slave.”\\n“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked.\\n“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and  \\nignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich.

My highly educated dad \\nhad a great education and a great career, but school never told him \\nhow to handle money or his fear of it. It became clear that I could \\nlearn different and important things from two fathers. \\n“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How \\ndoes the desire for money affect our thinking?” Mike asked. \\n“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you \\nnotice your desires rising?”\\nWe nodded our heads.\\n“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay  \\nyour reactions and think. That is important. We will always have \\nemotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it’s imperative for you \\nto use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not \\nlet your emotions control your thinking. Most people use fear and \\ngreed against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people \\nlive their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because \\nof the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those \\nemotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of \\na donkey dragging a cart with its owner dangling a carrot just in front \\nof its nose. The donkey’s owner may be going where he wants to, but \\nthe donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow there will only be another \\ncarrot for the donkey.”\\n“You mean the moment I picture a new baseball glove, candy and \\ntoys, that’s like a carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked.\\n“Yes, and as you get older, your toys get more expensive—a new \\ncar, a boat, and a big house to impress your friends,” said rich dad \\nwith a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you. \\nThat’s the trap.”\\n“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked.\\n“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich \\npeople with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get. \\nMoney is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the whole \\npicture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.”', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad35\\nRich dad went on to explain that a human’s life is a struggle  \\nbetween ignorance and illumination.\\nHe explained that once a person stops searching for information \\nand self-knowledge, ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-\\nmoment decision—to learn to open or close one’s mind.\\n“Look, school is very important. You go to school to learn a skill  \\nor profession to become a contributing member of society. Every  \\nculture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, businesspeople, \\npolice officers, firefighters, and soldiers. Schools train them so society \\ncan thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people \\nschool is the end, not the beginning.”\\nThere was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I didn’t \\ncomprehend everything he said that day. But as with most great \\nteachers, his words continued to teach for years. \\n“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. “But I want you \\nto always remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. \\nMartin. And I want you always to remember that donkey. Never \\nforget that fear and desire can lead you into life’s biggest trap if you’re \\nnot aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life \\nliving in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for \\nmoney, thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy \\nis also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about \\npaying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size \\nof a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job makes you  \\nsecure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want  \\nyou to avoid. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that \\nhappen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”\\nA softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw  \\nit back.\\n“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked. \\n“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed \\nand fear,” said rich dad. “Let me give you some examples. A doctor, \\nwanting more money to better provide for his family, raises his fees.  \\nBy raising his fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone.

Because the doctors raise their fees, the attorneys  \\nraise their fees. Because the attorneys’ fees have gone up, schoolteachers \\nwant a raise, which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. Soon there \\nwill be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos \\nwill break out and another great civilization will collapse. History \\nproves that great civilizations collapse when the gap between the haves \\nand have-nots is too great. Sadly, America is on that same course \\nbecause we haven’t learned from history. We only memorize historical \\ndates and names, not the lesson.”\\n“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked.\\n“In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should  \\nactually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory. \\nPrices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools \\ntaught people about money, there would be more money and lower \\nprices. But schools focus only on teaching people to work for money, \\nnot how to harness money’s power.”\\n“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “And haven’t \\nyou encouraged me to go for my MBA?”\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often business schools train  \\nemployees to become sophisticated bean-counters. Heaven forbid a bean-\\ncounter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire \\npeople, and kill the business. I know this because I hire bean-counters. \\nAll they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more \\nproblems. Bean-counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but \\nit, too, is not the whole picture,” added rich dad angrily.\\n“So is there an answer?” asked Mike.\\n“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not \\nthink with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions  \\nby agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. When you again \\nresisted your emotions when I tempted you with more money, you \\nwere again learning to think in spite of being emotionally charged. \\nThat’s the first step.”\\n“Why is that step so important?” I asked.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions. \\nInstead of just getting up and going to work because not having the \\nmoney to pay your bills is scaring you, ask yourself, ‘Is working harder \\nat this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are too afraid to \\nrationally think things through and instead run out the door to a job \\nthey hate.

He went on to \\nexplain that when Mike and I were casting five-cent pieces out of \\nlead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking \\nthe way the rich think. The problem was that creating money is legal \\nfor the government and banks to do, but illegal for us to do. There are \\nlegal ways to create money from nothing, he told us.\\nRich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an  \\nillusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey.

We went back to the park, to the same \\npicnic bench, and spent several more hours thinking and talking.\\nWe spent the next week at school thinking and talking, too. For \\ntwo more weeks, we kept thinking, talking, and working for free.\\nAt the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye \\nto Mrs. Martin and looking at the comic-book stand with a longing \\ngaze. The hard thing about not even getting 30 cents every Saturday \\nwas that I didn’t have any money to buy comic books. Suddenly, as \\nMrs. Martin said goodbye to Mike and me, I saw her do something I’d \\nnever seen her do before.\\nMrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half. \\nShe kept the top half of the comic book cover and threw the rest of the \\nbook into a large cardboard box.

Among \\nthem were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel \\ncompany; Samuel Insull, president of the world’s largest utility; \\nHoward Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger, \\npresident of International Match Co., one of the world’s largest \\ncompanies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of \\nInternational Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the \\nNew York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore, \\ntwo of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of \\nPresident Harding’s cabinet. T wenty-five years later, nine of these \\ntitans ended their lives as follows: Schwab died penniless after \\nliving for five years on borrowed money. Insull died broke in a \\nforeign land, and Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson \\nwent insane. Whitney and Albert Fall were released from prison, \\nand Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.\\nI doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men.  \\nIf you look at the date, 1923, it was just before the 1929 market crash \\nand the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great impact on \\nthese men and their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of \\ngreater and faster change than these men did.

Increased \\nspending throws families into greater debt and into more financial \\nuncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and \\nreceiving raises on a regular basis. This is high-risk living caused by \\nweak financial education.\\nThe massive loss of jobs in recent times proves how shaky the \\nmiddle class really is financially. Company pension plans are being \\nreplaced by 401(k) plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and \\ncan’t be relied upon as a source for retirement. Panic has set in for  \\nthe middle class. \\nToday, mutual funds are popular because they supposedly \\nrepresent safety. Average mutual-fund buyers are too busy working to \\npay taxes and mortgages, save for their children’s college, and pay off \\ncredit cards. They do not have time to study investing, so they rely \\non the expertise of the manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the \\nmutual fund includes many different types of investments, they feel \\ntheir money is safer because it is “diversified.” This educated middle \\nclass subscribes to the dogma put out by mutual-fund brokers and \\nfinancial planners: “Play it safe. Avoid risk.”\\nThe real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what \\ncreates the risk faced by average middle-class people. The reason they have \\nto play it safe is because their financial positions are tenuous at best. Their \\nbalance sheets are not balanced. Instead, they are loaded with liabilities \\nand have no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source \\nof income is their paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent \\non their employer. So when genuine “deals of a lifetime” come along, \\nthese people can’t take advantage of them because they are working so \\nhard, are taxed to the max, and are loaded with debt.\\nAs I said at the start of this section, the most important rule \\nis to know the difference between an asset and a liability.

Their lives \\nwill revolve around their wages or, as described earlier, their income \\ncolumn. Many will study further to become engineers, scientists, \\ncooks, police officers, artists, writers, and so on. These professional \\nskills allow them to enter the workforce and work for money.\\nBut there is a big difference between your profession and your \\nbusiness. Often I ask people, “What is your business?” And they will ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 86}),\n",

And \\nthey usually respond, “No, I work there.” In that instance, they have \\nconfused their profession with their business. Their profession may  \\nbe a banker, but they still need their own business.\\nA problem with school is that you often become what you study. \\nSo if you study cooking, you become a chef. If you study the law,  \\nyou become an attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you  \\na mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is that too \\nmany people forget to mind their own business. They spend their \\nlives minding someone else’s business and making that person rich.\\nTo become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own \\nbusiness. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your \\nincome column. As stated earlier, the number-one rule is to know  \\nthe difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets.  \\nThe rich focus on their asset columns, while everyone else focuses on \\ntheir income statements.\\nThat is why we hear so often: “I need a raise.” “If only I had a  \\npromotion.” “I am going back to school to get more training so I  \\ncan get a better job.” “I am going to \\nwork overtime.” “Maybe I can get a \\nsecond job.” \\nIn some circles, these are sensible \\nideas. But you are still not minding \\nyour own business. These ideas all still \\nfocus on the income column and will only help a person become more \\nfinancially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-\\ngenerating assets.\\nThe primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are \\nfiscally conservative—which means, “I can’t afford to take risks”— is \\nthat they have no financial foundation. They have to cling to their \\njobs and play it safe.\\nWhen downsizing became the “in” thing to do, millions of  \\nworkers found out their largest so-called asset, their home, was eating \\nthem alive.

What they thought were  \\nassets could not help them survive in a time of financial crisis. \\nI assume most of us have filled out a credit application to buy \\na house or a car.

They did not question the Armani suits, golf clubs,  \\nor art collection. Life is sometimes tough when you do not fit the  \\nstandard profile.\\nI cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth \\nis a million dollars or $100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main \\nreasons net worth is not accurate is simply because, the moment you \\nbegin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains.\\nSo many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble \\nwhen they run short of income. To raise cash, they sell their assets. \\nBut their personal assets can generally be sold for only a fraction of \\nthe value that is listed on their personal balance sheet.

That is why I say someone’s net worth is often \\n“worth less” than they think.\\nStart minding your own business.

It took approximately 50 years in both England and \\nthe United States to sell the idea of a regular income tax.\\nWhat these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes \\nwere initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad \\nwanted Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes \\nwas made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and \\nthe middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich.

It went to government workers in the form of  \\njobs and pensions, and it went to the rich via their factories receiving \\ngovernment contracts. The government received a large pool of money, \\nbut the problem was the fiscal management of that money. The \\ngovernment ideal is to avoid having excess money. If you fail to spend \\nyour allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would \\ncertainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the \\nother hand, are rewarded for having excess money and are applauded for \\ntheir efficiency. As this cycle of growing government spending continued, \\nthe demand for money increased, and the “tax-the-rich” idea was adjusted \\nto include lower-income levels, down to the very people who voted it in, \\nthe poor and the middle class.\\nT rue capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find an \\nescape. They headed back to the protection of a corporation. But \\nwhat many people who have never formed a corporation don’t know \\nis that a corporation is not really a thing. A corporation is merely a \\nfile folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s \\noffice and registered with a state government agency. It’s not a big \\nbuilding or a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a \\nlegal document that creates a legal body without a soul. Using it, the \\nwealth of the rich was once again protected.

For \\nexample, “1031” is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue \\nCode which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate \\nthat is sold for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive \\npiece of real estate. Real estate is one investment vehicle that has a great \\ntax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in value, you will not be \\ntaxed on the gains until you liquidate.

That is a whole area of \\nexpertise that is very exciting. Employees earn and get taxed, \\nand they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns,  \\nspends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is \\nleft. It’s one of the biggest legal tax  loopholes that the rich \\nuse. They’re easy to set up and are not expensive if you own \\ninvestments that are producing good cashflow.

The more real you \\nthink money is, the harder you will work for it. If you can grasp  the idea \\nthat money is not real, you will grow richer faster.”\\n“What is it?” was a question Mike and I often came back with. \\n“What is money if it is not real?”\\n“What we agree it is,” was all rich dad would say.\\nThe single most powerful asset we all have is our mind.

A few \\nindividuals are getting ridiculously rich from nothing, just ideas and \\nagreements. If you ask many people \\nwho trade stocks or other investments \\nfor a living, they see it done all the \\ntime. Often, millions can be made \\ninstantaneously from nothing. And \\nby nothing, I mean no money was \\nexchanged. It is done via agreement: a \\nhand signal in a trading pit, a blip on a \\ntrader’s screen in Lisbon from a trader’s screen in Toronto and back to \\nLisbon, a call to my broker to buy and a moment later to sell.

In the early \\n1990s, the economy of Phoenix, Arizona, was horrible. I was watching a \\nTV show when a financial planner came on and began forecasting doom \\nand gloom. His advice was to save money. “Put $100 away every month,” \\nhe said. “In 40 years you will be a multimillionaire.”\\nWell, putting money away every month is a sound idea. It is one \\noption—the option most people subscribe to. The problem is this: It \\nblinds the person to what is really going on. It causes them to miss major \\nopportunities for much more significant growth of their money. The \\nworld is passing them by.\\nAs I said, the economy was terrible at that time. For investors, \\nthis is the perfect market condition. A chunk of my money was \\nin the stock market and in apartment houses. I was short of cash. \\nBecause people were giving properties away, I was buying. I was not \\nsaving money. I was investing. Kim and I had more than a million \\ndollars in cash working in a market that was rising fast. It was the best \\nopportunity to invest. The economy was terrible. I just could not pass \\nup these small deals.\\nHouses that were once $100,000 were now $75,000. But instead \\nof shopping with local real estate agents, I began shopping at the \\nbankruptcy attorney’s office, or the courthouse steps. In these  \\nshopping places, a $75,000 house could sometimes be bought for \\n$20,000 or less. For $2,000, which was loaned to me from a friend \\nfor 90 days for $200, I gave an attorney a cashier’s check as a down \\npayment. While the acquisition was being processed, I ran an ad \\nadvertising a $75,000 house for only $60,000 and no money down.

It was the learned skill  \\nof raising money, more than the houses themselves, that  \\nwas priceless.\\n All too often I hear people say, “The bank won’t lend me  \\nmoney,” or “I don’t have the money to buy it.” If you want to \\nbe a type-two investor, you need to learn how to do that which \\nstops most people. In other words, a majority of people let their \\nlack of money stop them from making a deal. If you can avoid \\nthat obstacle, you will be millions ahead of those who don’t \\nlearn those skills. There have been many times I have bought \\na house, a stock, or an apartment building without a penny in \\nthe bank. I once bought an apartment house for $1.2 million.  \\nI did what is called “tying it up,” with a written contract \\nbetween seller and buyer. \\n I then raised the $100,000 deposit, which bought me 90 days \\nto raise the rest of the money. Why did I do it? Simply because \\nI knew it was worth $2 million. I never raised the money. \\nInstead,the person who put up the $100,000 gave me $50,000 ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

Organize smart people.  \\nIntelligent people are those who work with or hire a  \\nperson  who is more intelligent than they are. When you  \\nneed advice, make sure you choose your advisor wisely.\\nThere is a lot to learn, but the rewards can be astronomical.

Her articles \\nheld a reader’s interest.\\n“You have a great style,” I said in reply. “What holds you back \\nfrom achieving your dream?”\\n“My work does not seem to go anywhere,” she said quietly.  \\n“Everyone says that my novels are excellent, but nothing happens.  \\nSo I keep my job with the paper. At least it pays the bills. Do you \\nhave any suggestions?”\\n“Yes, I do,” I said brightly. “A friend of mine here in Singapore \\nruns a school that trains people to sell.

In my attempt to be helpful, I found myself  \\ndefending my suggestion. “I have a master’s degree in English \\nLiterature.

The interview was over.\\nOn the coffee table sat a copy of an earlier best-selling book I wrote.  \\nI picked it up as well as the notes she had jotted down on her legal pad. \\n“Do you see this?” I said pointing to her notes.\\nShe looked down at her notes. “What?” she said, confused.  \\nAgain, I pointed deliberately to her notes. On her pad she had \\nwritten: “Robert Kiyosaki, best-selling author.”\\n“It says best-selling author, not best-writing author,” I said quietly.\\nHer eyes widened.\\n“I am a terrible writer,” I said. “You are a great writer. I went to  \\nsales school. You have a master’s degree.

He could \\nnot understand my decision to resign from a career that offered high \\npay, great benefits, lots of time off, and opportunity for promotion. \\nWhen he asked me one evening, “Why did you quit?” I could not \\nexplain it to him, though I tried hard to.

So as a student, I made cargo runs, navigating large freighters, oil \\ntankers, and passenger ships to the Far East and the South Pacific. Rich \\ndad emphasized that I should stay in the Pacific instead of taking ships \\nto Europe because he knew that the emerging nations were in Asia, not \\nEurope.

He has just been fired, \\nand he is asking the entire company, “Who wants to come with me?” \\nAnd the whole place is silent and frozen. Only one woman speaks up \\nand says, “I’d like to, but I’m due for a promotion in three months.”\\nThat statement is probably the most truthful statement in the whole \\nmovie. It is the type of statement that people use to keep themselves busy, \\nworking away to pay bills. I know my educated dad looked forward to his \\npay raise every year, and every year he was disappointed. So he would go \\nback to school to earn more qualifications so he could get another raise. \\nThen, once again, there would be another disappointment.\\nThe question I often ask people is, “Where is this daily activity  \\ntaking you?” Just like the little hamster, I wonder if people look at \\nwhere their hard work is taking them. What does the future hold? \\nIn his book  The Retirement Myth, Craig S. Karpel writes: “I visited \\nthe headquarters of a major national pension consulting firm and met \\nwith a managing director who specializes in designing lush retirement \\nplans for top management. When I asked her what people who don’t \\nhave corner offices will be able to expect in the way of pension income, \\nshe said with a confident smile, ‘The Silver Bullet’.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 135}),\n",

It \\nis not a pretty picture for most people working today. And that is just \\nfor retirement. Add medical fees and long-term nursing-home care \\nand  the picture is frightening. \\nAlready, many hospitals in countries with socialized medicine \\nneed to make tough decisions such as, “Who will live, and who will \\ndie?” They make those decisions purely on how much money they \\nhave and how old the patients are. If the patient is old, they often will \\ngive the medical care to someone younger. The older poor patient \\ngets put to the back of the line. Just as the rich can afford better \\neducation, the rich will be able to keep themselves alive, while those \\nwho have little wealth will die.\\nSo I wonder: Are workers looking into the future or just until \\ntheir next paycheck, never questioning where they are headed?\\nWhen I speak to adults who want to earn more money, I always  \\nrecommend the same thing. I suggest taking a long view of their life.  \\nInstead of simply working for the money and security, which I admit \\nare important, I suggest they take a second job that will teach them \\na second skill. Often I recommend joining a network-marketing \\ncompany, also called multilevel marketing, if they want to learn sales \\nskills. Some of these companies have excellent training programs that \\nhelp people get over their fear of failure and rejection, which are the \\nmain reasons people are unsuccessful.

The most  \\npainful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There \\nhave been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am \\nthere and in motion, it is a pleasure. After the workout is over, I am \\nalways glad I talked myself into going.\\nIf you are unwilling to work to learn something new and instead \\ninsist on becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the  \\ncompany you work for is unionized. Labor unions are designed to \\nprotect specialists. My educated dad, after falling from grace with \\nthe governor, became the head of the teachers union in Hawaii. He \\ntold me that it was the hardest job he ever held. My rich dad, on the \\nother hand, spent his life doing his best to keep his companies from \\nbecoming unionized. He was successful. Although the unions came \\nclose, rich dad was always able to fight them off. \\nPersonally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and \\nthe benefits of both sides. If you do as school recommends, become \\nhighly specialized. Then seek union protection. For example, had I \\ncontinued with my flying career, I would have sought a company that \\nhad a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated \\nto learning a skill that was valuable in only one industry. If I were \\npushed out of that industry, my life’s skills would not be as valuable \\nto another industry. A displaced senior pilot—with 100,000 hours of \\nheavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year—would have a \\nhard time finding an equivalent high-paying job teaching in school. \\nSkills do not necessarily transfer from industry to industry.

We’re all heroes at something, and \\ncowards at something else. My friend’s wife is an emergency-room \\nnurse. When she sees blood, she flies into action. When I mention \\ninvesting, she runs away. When I see blood, I don’t run. I pass out.\\nMy rich dad understood phobias about money. “Some people are \\nterrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. Both \\nare phobias,” he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing \\nmoney was this little rhyme: “If you hate risk and worry, start early.”\\nIf you start young, it’s easier to be rich. I won’t go into it here,  \\nbut there is a staggering difference between a person who starts \\ninvesting at age 20 versus age 30. The purchase of Manhattan Island \\nis said to be one of the greatest bargains of all time. New York was \\npurchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet if that $24 had been \\ninvested at 8 percent annually, that $24 would have been worth more \\nthan $28 trillion by 1995. Manhattan could be repurchased with \\nmoney left over to buy much of Los Angeles.\\nBut what if you don’t have much time left or would like to retire \\nearly? How do you handle the fear of losing money?\\nMy poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing  \\nto discuss the subject.\\nMy rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think  \\nlike a Texan. “I like Texas and Texans,” he used to say. “In Texas, \\neverything is bigger. When Texans win, they win big. And when  \\nthey lose, it’s spectacular.”\\n“They like losing?” I asked.\\n“That’s not what I’m saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy \\nloser, and I’ll show you a loser,” said rich dad. “It’s a Texan’s attitude \\ntoward risk, reward, and failure I’m talking about. It’s how they handle \\nlife. They live it big. Not like most of the people around here, living \\nlike roaches when it comes to money, terrified that someone will shine \\na light on them, and whimpering when the grocery clerk shortchanges \\nthem a quarter.” ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",

I’ve never met \\npeople who have fallen in love who have never had their heart broken. \\nAnd I’ve never met someone rich who has never lost money.\\nSo for most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because \\nthe pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich. \\nAnother saying in Texas is, “Everyone wants to go to heaven,  \\nbut no one wants to die.” Most people dream of being rich, but are \\nterrified of losing money. So they never \\nget to heaven.\\nRich dad used to tell Mike and me \\nstories about his trips to Texas. “If you \\nreally want to learn the attitude of how \\nto handle risk, losing, and failure, go to \\nSan Antonio and visit the Alamo. The \\nAlamo is a great story of brave people \\nwho chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of success. They chose \\nto die instead of surrendering. It’s an inspiring story worthy of study. \\nNonetheless, it’s still a tragic military defeat. They got their butts \\nkicked. So how do Texans handle failure? They still shout, ‘Remember \\nthe Alamo!’”\\nMike and I heard this story a lot. He always told us this story when \\nhe was about to go into a big deal, and he was nervous.

It’s not \\nthat he wanted to lose. He just knew who he was and how he would \\ntake a loss. He would take a loss and make it a win. That’s what made \\nhim a winner and others losers. It gave him the courage to cross the line \\nwhen others backed out. “That’s why I like Texans so much,” he would \\nsay. “They took a great failure and turned it into inspiration… as well a \\ntourist destination that makes them millions.”\\nBut probably his words that mean the most to me today are these: \\n“Texans don’t bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take \\ntheir failures and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans \\nto become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. \\nIt is the formula for all winners.”\\nI’ve said that falling off my bike was part of learning to ride. I  \\nremember falling off only made me more determined to learn to ride, \\nnot less. I also said that I have never \\nmet a golfer who has never lost a ball. \\nFor top professional golfers, losing \\na ball or a tournament provides the \\ninspiration to be better, to practice \\nharder, to study more. That’s what makes them better. For winners, \\nlosing inspires them. For losers, losing defeats them.\\nI like to quote John D.

But, more \\nimportantly, a great property manager allows me to buy a lot more real \\nestate since I don’t have to fix toilets. A great property manager is key to \\nsuccess in real estate. Finding a good manager is more important to me \\nthan the real estate.

With that information, I immediately began \\nlooking for and found a new, undervalued oil company that was  \\nabout to find some oil deposits. My broker was excited about this  \\nnew company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per share.\\nThree months later, this same friend and I drove by the same gas \\nstation, and sure enough, the price per gallon had gone up nearly  \\n15 percent. Again, the Chicken Little worried and complained. I \\nsmiled because, a month earlier, that little oil company hit oil and \\nthose 15,000 shares went up to more than $3 per share since he had \\nfirst given me the tip. And the price of gas will continue to go up if \\nwhat my friend says is true. \\nIf most people understood how a “stop” worked in stock-market  \\ninvesting, there would be more people investing to win instead of  \\ninvesting not to lose.

His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and \\nhis wife had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship \\nstrong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his performance at work \\nslips and he loses his job.\\nToday, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their \\nwealth. And there are people too busy to take care of their health. The \\ncause is the same. They’re busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding \\nsomething they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep \\ndown they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with \\nanger or irritation.\\nIf they aren’t busy at work or with the kids, they’re often busy \\nwatching TV, fishing, playing golf, or shopping. Yet deep down \\nthey know they are avoiding something important. That’s the most \\ncommon form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.\\nSo what is the cure for laziness? The answer is—a little greed.\\nFor many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad. \\n“Greedy people are bad people,” my mom used to say.

I’m buying this for you because I never had this advantage \\nwhen I was a kid.” I have a neighbor who is stone-broke but can’t park \\nhis car in his garage. The garage is filled with toys for his kids. Those \\nspoiled brats get everything they ask for.  \\n“I don’t want them to know the \\nfeeling of want” are his everyday \\nwords. He has nothing set aside for \\ntheir college or his retirement, but \\nhis kids have every toy ever made. \\nHe recently got a new credit card in \\nthe mail and took his kids to visit Las \\nVegas. “I’m doing it for the kids,” he \\nsaid with great sacrifice.\\nRich dad forbade the words, “I can’t afford it.” In my real home, \\nthat’s all I heard.

It didn’t have to think anymore. “How can I afford \\nit?” opened up the brain and forced it to think and search for answers.\\nBut most importantly, he felt the words, “I can’t afford it,” were \\na lie. And the human spirit knows it. “The human spirit is very, very \\npowerful,” he would say. “It knows it can do anything.” By having a \\nlazy mind that says, “I can’t afford it,” a war breaks out inside you.

So rich dad was not so \\nconcerned about what we wanted to buy as long as we understood that \\n“How can I afford it?” creates a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit.\\nThus he rarely gave Mike or me anything. He would instead ask, \\n“How can you afford it?” and that included college, which we paid  \\nfor ourselves. It was not the goal, but the process of attaining the goal  \\nthat he wanted us to learn.\\nThe problem I see today is that there are millions of people who \\nfeel guilty about their desire or their “greed.” It’s old conditioning  \\nfrom their childhood. While they desire to have the finer things that \\nlife offers, most have been conditioned subconsciously to say, “I can’t \\nhave that,” or “I’ll never be able to afford that.”\\nWhen I decided to exit the Rat Race, it was simply a question \\nof “How can I afford to never work again?” And my mind began to \\nkick out answers and solutions. The hardest part was fighting my real \\nparents’ dogma: “We can’t afford that.” “Stop thinking only about  \\nyourself.”  “Why don’t you think about others?” and other similar  \\nsentiments designed to instill guilt to suppress my “greed.”\\nSo how do you beat laziness? Once again, the answer is a little \\ngreed. It’s that radio station WII-FM, which stands for “What’s In  \\nIt For Me?” A person needs to sit down and ask, “What would my \\nlife be like if I never had to work again?” “What would I do if I had \\nall the money I needed?” Without that little greed, the desire to have \\nsomething better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because \\nwe all desire a better life. New inventions are made because we desire \\nsomething better. We go to school and study hard because we want \\nsomething better. So whenever you find yourself avoiding something  ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

It’s the best cure for laziness.\\nToo much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good. \\nBut just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street : \\n“Greed is good.” Rich dad said it differently: “Guilt is worse than greed, \\nfor guilt robs the body of its soul.” I think Eleanor Roosevelt said it best: \\n“Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you’ll be criticized \\nanyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”\\nOvercoming Bad Habits\\nOur lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education. After \\nseeing the movie Conan the Barbarian,  starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, \\na friend said, “I’d love to have a body like Schwarzenegger.” Most of the \\nguys nodded in agreement.\\n“I even heard he was really puny and skinny at one time,” another \\nfriend added.\\n“Yeah, I heard that too,” another one said. “I heard he has a habit of \\nworking out almost every day in the gym.”\\n“Yeah, I’ll bet he has to.”\\n“Nah,” said the group cynic. “I’ll bet he was born that way. Besides, \\nlet’s stop talking about Arnold and get some beers.”\\nThis is an example of habits controlling behavior. I remember  \\nasking my rich dad about the habits of the rich. Instead of answering me \\noutright, he wanted me to learn through example, as usual.\\n“When does your dad pay his bills?” rich dad asked.\\n“The first of the month,” I said.\\n“Does he have anything left over?” he asked.\\n“Very little,” I said.\\n“That’s the main reason he struggles,” said rich dad. “He has  \\nbad habits. Your dad pays everyone else first. He pays himself last, but \\nonly if he has anything left over.”\\n“Which he usually doesn’t,” I said. “But he has to pay his bills, doesn’t \\nhe? You’re saying he shouldn’t pay his bills?”', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

Before I pay even the government.”\\n“But what happens if you don’t have enough money?” I asked.  \\n“What do you do then?”\\n“The same,” said rich dad. “I still pay myself first. Even if I’m  \\nshort of money. My asset column is far more important to me than  \\nthe government.”\\n“But,” I said. “Don’t they come after you?”\\n“Yes, if you don’t pay,” said rich dad. “Look, I did not say not to pay. \\nI just said I pay myself first, even if I’m short of money.”\\n“But,” I replied. “How do you do that?” \\n“It’s not how. The question is ‘Why?’” rich dad said.\\n“Okay, why?”\\n“Motivation,” said rich dad. “Who do you think will complain \\nlouder if I don’t pay them—me, or my creditors?”\\n“Your creditors will definitely scream louder than you,” I said,  \\nresponding to the obvious. “You wouldn’t say anything if you didn’t  \\npay yourself.” \\n“So you see, after paying myself, the pressure to pay my taxes and \\nthe other creditors is so great that it forces me to seek other forms of \\nincome. The pressure to pay becomes my motivation. I’ve worked extra \\njobs, started other companies, traded in the stock market, anything just \\nto make sure those guys don’t start yelling at me. That pressure made me \\nwork harder, forced me to think, and all in all, made me smarter and \\nmore active when it comes to money. If I had paid myself last, I would \\nhave felt no pressure, but I’d be broke.”\\n“So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money \\nto that motivates you?”\\n“That’s right,” said rich dad. “You see, government bill collectors are \\nbig bullies. So are bill collectors in general. Most people give into these \\nbullies. They pay them and never pay themselves. You know the story of \\nthe 98-pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?”\\nI nodded. “I see that ad for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons  \\nin the comic books all the time.”', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",

The \\nmore I work my mental money muscles out, the stronger I get. Now I’m \\nnot afraid of those bullies.”\\nI liked what rich dad was saying. “So if I pay myself first, I get \\nfinancially stronger, mentally and fiscally.”\\nRich dad nodded.\\n“And if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like \\nbosses, managers, tax collectors, bill collectors, and landlords push me \\naround all my life—just because I don’t have good money habits.” \\nRich dad nodded. “Just like the 98-pound weakling.”\\nOvercoming Arrogance \\n“What I know makes me money.

I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us. \\nThe problem is that our financial genius lies asleep, waiting to be called \\nupon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that \\nthe love of money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a \\nprofession so we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have \\nmoney work for us. It taught us not to worry about our financial future \\nbecause our company or the government would take care of us when \\nour working days are over. However, it is our children, educated in the \\nsame school system, who will end up paying for this absence of financial \\neducation.

Your financial genius is smart enough \\nto develop its own list.\\nWhile in Peru, I asked a gold miner of 45 years how he was so  \\nconfident about finding a gold mine. He replied, “There is gold  \\neverywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.”\\nAnd I would say that is true. In real estate, I can go out and \\nin a day come up with four or five great potential deals, while the \\naverage person will go out and find nothing, even looking in the same \\nneighborhood. The reason is that they have not taken the time to \\ndevelop their financial genius.\\nI offer you the following 10 steps as a process to develop your  \\nGod-given powers, powers over which only you have control.\\n1. Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit \\nIf you ask most people if they would like to be rich or financially \\nfree, they would say yes. But then reality sets in. The road seems too \\nlong with too many hills to climb. It’s easier to just work for money  \\nand hand the excess over to your broker.\\nI once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming for  \\nthe U.S. Olympic team. The reality was that she had to get up every \\nmorning at four o’clock to swim for three hours before going to \\nschool. She did not party with her friends on Saturday night. She had \\nto study and keep her grades up, just like everyone else.\\nWhen I asked her what fueled her super-human ambition and  \\nsacrifice, she simply said, “I do it for myself and the people I love. It’s  \\nlove that gets me over the hurdles and sacrifices.”\\nA reason or a purpose is a combination of “wants” and “don’t \\nwants.” When people ask me what my reason for wanting to be rich \\nis, I tell them that it is a combination of deep emotional “wants” and \\n“don’t wants.”\\nI will list a few: first, the “don’t wants,” for they create the “wants.”  \\nI don’t want to work all my life. I don’t want what my parents aspired for,  \\nwhich was job security and a house in the suburbs.  I don’t like being an \\nemployee.

I hated it when my dad worked \\nhard all his life and the government took most of what he worked for \\nat his death. He could not even pass on what he worked so hard for \\nwhen he died. The rich don’t do that. They work hard and pass it on \\nto their children.\\nNow the “wants.” I want to be free to travel the world and live \\nin the lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this. I want \\nto simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want \\nmoney to work for me.\\nThose are my deep-seated emotional reasons. What are yours?  \\nIf they are not strong enough, then the reality of the road ahead may  \\nbe greater than your reasons. I have lost money and been set back many \\ntimes, but it was the deep emotional reasons that kept me standing up \\nand going forward. I wanted to be free by age 40, but it took me until  \\nI was 47, with many learning experiences along the way.\\nAs I said, I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn’t. But it wasn’t  \\nthat hard either.  I’ve learned that, without a strong reason or purpose, \\nanything in life is hard.\\nIF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STRONG REASON, THERE IS NO SENSE \\nREADING FURTHER. IT WILL SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH WORK . \\n2. Make daily choices: the power of choice\\nChoice is the main reason people want to live in a free country.  \\nWe want the power to choose.\\nFinancially, with every dollar we get in our hands, we hold the  \\npower to choose our future: to be rich, poor, or middle class. Our \\nspending habits reflect who we are. Poor people simply have poor \\nspending habits. The benefit I had as a boy was that I loved playing \\nMonopoly constantly. Nobody told me Monopoly was only for kids, \\nso I just kept playing the game as an adult. I also had a rich dad who \\npointed out to me the difference between an asset and a liability. So \\na long time ago, as a little boy, I chose to be rich, and I knew that \\nall I had to do was learn to acquire assets, real assets.

Many rich families lose their assets in the next \\ngeneration simply because there was no one trained to be a good \\nsteward over their assets.\\nMost people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population, \\nbeing rich is too much of a hassle. So they invent sayings that go: “I’m \\nnot interested in money.” “I’ll never be rich.” “I don’t have to worry. \\nI’m still young.” “When I make some money, then I’ll think about my \\nfuture.” “My husband/wife handles the finances.” The problem with \\nthose statements is that they rob the person who chooses to think such \\nthoughts of two things: One is time, which is your most precious asset. \\nThe second is learning. Having no money should not be an excuse to  \\nnot learn. But that is a choice we all make daily: the choice of what we  \\ndo with our time, our money, and what we put in our heads. That is  \\nthe power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and  \\nI make that choice every day.\\nInvest first in education. In reality, the only real asset you have is your \\nmind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over. Each of us has the \\nchoice of what we put in our brain once we’re old enough. You can watch \\nTV, read golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial \\nplanning. You choose. Most people simply buy investments rather than \\nfirst investing in learning about investing.\\nA friend of mine recently had her apartment burglarized. The \\nthieves took her electronics and left all the books. And we all have that \\nsame choice. 90 percent of the population buys TV sets, and only about  \\n10 percent buy business books. \\nSo what do I do? I go to seminars. I like it when they are at least two \\ndays long because I like to immerse myself in a subject. In 1973, I was \\nwatching this guy on TV who was advertising a three-day seminar on \\nhow to buy real estate for nothing down. I spent $385 and that course \\nhas made me at least $2 million, if not more. But more importantly, it \\nbought me life. I don’t have to work for the rest of my life because of  \\nthat one course.

I have two \\nways to analyze a problem or trend, and that is priceless. Today, I often \\nsay, “How would Donald T rump do this, or Warren Buffett or George \\nSoros?” The only way I can access their vast mental power is to be humble \\nenough to read or listen to what they have to say. Arrogant or critical \\npeople are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid of taking \\nrisks. That’s because, if you learn something new, you are then required  \\nto make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned.\\nIf you have read this far, arrogance is not one of your problems. \\nArrogant people rarely read or listen to experts. Why should they? \\nThey are the center of the universe.\\nThere are so many “intelligent” people who argue or defend when \\na new idea clashes with the way they think. In this case, their so-called \\nintelligence combined with arrogance equals ignorance. Each of us \\nknows people who are highly educated, or believe they are smart, but \\ntheir balance sheet paints a different picture. A truly intelligent person \\nwelcomes new ideas, for new ideas can add to the synergy of other  \\naccumulated ideas. Listening is more important than talking. If that \\nwere not true, God would not have given us two ears and only one \\nmouth. Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening  \\nin order to absorb new ideas and possibilities. They argue instead of \\nasking questions.\\nI take a long view on my wealth. I do not subscribe to the  \\nget-rich-quick mentality most lottery players or casino gamblers have.  \\nI may go in and out of stocks, but I am long on education. If you  \\nwant to fly an airplane, I advise taking lessons first. I am always  \\nshocked at people who buy stocks or real estate, but never invest in \\ntheir greatest asset, their mind.

They don’t do it to brag. They’re interested in the \\nsubject. So I learn from them, and they learn from me. My friends \\nwho are in dire financial straits do not like talking about money, \\nbusiness, or investing. They often think it rude or unintellectual. So \\nI also learn from my friends who struggle financially. I find out what \\nnot to do.\\nI have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in \\ntheir short lifetimes. The three of them report the same phenomenon: \\nTheir friends who have no money have never come to them to ask \\nthem how they did it. But they do come asking for one of two things, \\nor both: a loan, or a job.\\nWARNING: Don’t listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, and \\nwhile I love them dearly, they are the Chicken Littles of life. To them, when it \\ncomes to money, especially investments, it’s always, “The sky is falling! The sky \\nis falling!” They can always tell you why something won’t work. The problem \\nis that people listen to them. But people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom \\ninformation are also Chicken Littles. As that old saying goes, “Birds of a feather \\nflock together.”\\nIf you watch business channels on TV, they often have a panel \\nof so-called experts. One expert will say the market is going to crash, \\nand the other will say it’s going to boom. If you’re smart, you listen \\nto both. Keep your mind open, because both have valid points. \\nUnfortunately, most poor people listen to Chicken Little.\\nI have had many close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an \\ninvestment.

As we used to say as surfers: \\n“There is always another wave.” People who hurry and catch a wave \\nlate usually are the ones who wipe out.\\nSmart investors don’t time the markets. If they miss a wave, they \\nsearch for the next one and get themselves in position. This is hard \\nfor most investors because buying what is not popular is frightening. \\nTimid investors are like sheep going along with the crowd. Or their \\ngreed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their \\nprofits and moved on. Wise investors buy an investment when it’s not \\npopular. They know their profits are made when they buy, not when \\nthey sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do not time the market. \\nJust like a surfer, they get in position for the next big swell.\\nIt’s all “insider trading.” There are forms of insider trading that are \\nillegal, and there are forms of insider trading that are legal. But either \\nway, it’s insider trading. The only distinction is: How far away from \\nthe inside are you? The reason you want to have rich friends is because \\nthat is where the money is made.

My accountant \\nand bookkeeper screamed in panic, “They’re going to come after you. \\nThe IRS is going to put you in jail.” “You’re going to ruin your credit \\nrating.” “They’ll cut off the electricity.” I still paid myself first.\\n“Why?” you ask. Because that’s what the story, The Richest Man In \\nBabylon,  was all about: the power of self-discipline and the power of \\ninternal fortitude. As my rich dad taught me the first month I worked \\nfor him, most people allow the world to push them around. A bill  \\ncollector calls and you “pay or else.” A sales clerk says, “Oh, just put it \\non your charge card.” Your real estate agent tells you, “Go ahead.   \\nThe government allows you a tax deduction on your home.” That is \\nwhat the book is really about—having the guts to go against the tide \\nand get rich. You may not be weak, but when it comes to money, \\nmany people get wimpy.\\nI am not saying be irresponsible. The reason I don’t have high  \\ncredit-card debt, and doodad debt, is because I pay myself first. The \\nreason I minimize my income is because I don’t want to pay it to the \\ngovernment. That is why my income comes from my asset column, \\nthrough a Nevada corporation. If I work for money, the government \\ntakes it.\\nAlthough I pay my bills last, I am financially astute enough to not \\nget into a tough financial situation. I don’t like consumer debt. I actually \\nhave liabilities that are higher than 99 percent of the population, but I \\ndon’t pay for them. Other people pay for my liabilities. They’re called \\ntenants. So rule number one in paying yourself first is: Don’t get into \\nconsumer debt in the first place.

I generally pay them right away anyway. Kim \\nand I have excellent credit. We just don’t cave in to pressure and spend \\nour savings or liquidate stocks to pay for consumer debt.

Keep \\nyour expenses low. Build up assets first. Then buy the big house or \\nnice car. Being stuck in the Rat Race is not intelligent.\\n2. When you come up short, let the pressure build and don’t dip  \\ninto your savings or investments.

My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I \\nwas like a good soldier defending the fort—Fort Assets.\\nPoor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently \\ncalled “dipping into savings.” The rich know that savings are only used to \\ncreate more money, not to pay bills.\\nI know that sounds tough, but as I said, if you’re not tough inside, \\nthe world will always push you around anyway.\\nIf you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works \\nfor you. A good one is to cut expenses, put your money in the bank, pay \\nmore than your fair share of income tax, buy safe mutual funds, and take \\nthe vow of the average.

Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice \\nSometimes I see people posting a sign in front of their house that  \\nsays, “For Sale by Owner.” Or I see people on TV claiming to be  \\n“Discount Brokers.”\\nMy rich dad taught me to take the opposite approach. He believed  \\nin paying professionals well, and I have adopted that policy also.  \\nToday, I have expensive attorneys, accountants, real estate brokers,  \\nand stockbrokers. Why? Because if, and I do mean if, the people are  \\nprofessionals, their services should make you money. And the more \\nmoney they make, the more money I make.\\nWe live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good \\nbroker should provide you with information, as well as take the time to \\neducate you. I have several brokers who do that for me. Some taught \\nme when I had little or no money, and I am still with them today.\\nWhat I pay a broker is tiny in comparison with what kind of  \\nmoney I can make because of the information they provide. I love  \\nit when my real estate broker or stockbroker makes a lot of money \\nbecause that usually means I made a lot of money.\\nA good broker saves me time, in addition to making me money—  \\nlike when I bought the vacant land for $9,000 and sold it immediately \\nfor over $25,000 so I could buy my Porsche quicker.\\nA broker is my eyes and ears in the market. They’re there every day \\nso I do not have to be. I’d rather play golf.\\nPeople who sell their house on their own must not value their time \\nmuch. Why would I want to save a few bucks when I could use that \\ntime to make more money or spend it with those I love? What I find \\nfunny is that so many poor and middle-class people insist on tipping \\nrestaurant help 15 to 20 percent, even for bad service, but complain \\nabout paying a broker three to seven percent. They enjoy tipping \\npeople in the expense column and stiffing people in the asset column. \\nThat is not financially intelligent.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 172}),\n",

They sell, but they themselves own \\nlittle or no real estate. There is a tremendous difference between a broker \\nwho sells houses and a broker who sells investments. The same is true for \\nstock, bond, mutual fund, and insurance, brokers who call themselves \\nfinancial planners. \\nWhen I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much  \\nproperty or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in \\ntaxes. And that applies to my tax attorney as well as my accountant.  \\nI have an accountant who minds his own business. His profession is  \\naccounting, but his business is real estate. I used to have an accountant \\nwho was a small-business accountant, but he had no real estate. I \\nswitched because we did not love the same business.\\nFind a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will \\nspend the time educating you, and they could be the best asset you find. \\nJust be fair, and most of them will be fair to you. If all you can think \\nabout is cutting their commissions, then why should they want to help \\nyou? It’s just simple logic.\\nAs I said earlier, one of the management skills is the management \\nof people. Many people only manage people they feel smarter than and \\nthey have power over. Many middle managers remain middle managers, \\nfailing to get promoted, because they know how to work with people \\nbelow them, but not with people above them. The real skill is to manage \\nand reward the people who are smarter than you in some technical area. \\nThat is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one \\ntoo. That is financial intelligence.\\n7. Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing \\nWhen the first European settlers came to America, they were taken \\naback by a cultural practice some American Indians had. For example, if a \\nsettler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it \\nfor a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back.\\nThe Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not \\nwant to give it back. That is where the term “Indian giver” came from,  \\na simple cultural misunderstanding.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Chapter Eight: Getting Started160\\nIn the world of the asset column, being an Indian giver is vital to \\nwealth. The sophisticated investor’s first question is: “How fast do I  \\nget my money back?” They also want to know what they get for free, \\nalso called a “piece of the action.” That is why the ROI, or return on \\ninvestment, is so important.\\nFor example, I found a small condominium that was in foreclosure \\na few blocks from where I lived. The bank wanted $60,000, and I \\nsubmitted a bid for $50,000, which \\nthey took, simply because, along \\nwith my bid, was a cashier’s check for \\n$50,000. They realized I was serious. \\nMost investors would say, “Aren’t you \\ntying up a lot of cash? Would it not be \\nbetter to get a loan on it?” The answer \\nis, “Not in this case.” My investment company uses this condominium \\nas a vacation rental in the winter months when the “snowbirds” \\ncome to Arizona. It rents for $2,500 a month for four months out of \\nthe year. For rental during the off-season, it rents for only $1,000 a \\nmonth. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this \\nasset, which pumps money out for me, month in and month out.\\nThe same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker calls and  \\nrecommends I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a \\ncompany that he feels is just about to make a move that will add value \\nto the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money \\nin for a week to a month while the stock moves up. Then I pull my \\ninitial dollar amount out, and stop worrying about the fluctuations of \\nthe market, because my initial money is back and ready to work on \\nanother asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own \\nan asset that was technically free.\\nT rue, I have lost money on many occasions, but I only play with \\nmoney I can afford to lose. I would say, on an average 10 investments, \\nI hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I \\nlose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in \\nat that time.The sophisticated  \\ninvestor’s first  \\nquestion is: \\n“How fast do I get my \\nmoney back?”', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Rich Dad Poor Dad161\\nPeople who hate risk put their money in the bank. In the long run, \\nsafe savings are better than no savings. But it takes a long time to get \\nyour money back and, in most instances, you don’t get anything for  \\nfree with it. \\nOn every one of my investments, there must be an upside,  \\nsomething for free—like a condominium, a mini-storage, a piece  \\nof free land, a house, stock shares, or an office building. And there \\nmust be limited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are books devoted \\nentirely to this subject, so I will not talk about it here. Ray Kroc, of \\nMcDonald’s fame, sold hamburger franchises, not because he loved \\nhamburgers, but because he wanted the real estate under the franchise \\nfor free.\\nSo wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at  \\nthe assets they get for free once they get their money back. That is  \\nfinancial intelligence.\\n8. Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus\\nA friend’s child has been developing a nasty habit of burning a \\nhole in his pocket. Just 16, he wanted his own car. The excuse: “All his \\nfriends’ parents gave their kids cars.” The child wanted to go into his \\nsavings and use it for a down payment. That was when his father called \\nme and then came to see me.\\n“Do you think I should let him do it, or should I just buy him a car?”\\nI answered, “It might relieve the pressure in the short term, but what \\nhave you taught him in the long term? Can you use this desire to own a \\ncar and inspire your son to learn something?” Suddenly the lights went \\non, and he hurried home.\\nT wo months later I ran into my friend again. “Does your son have \\nhis new car?” I asked.\\n“No, he doesn’t. But I gave him $3,000 for the car. I told him to \\nuse my money instead of his college money.”\\n“Well, that’s generous of you,” I said.\\n“Not really.

We then had  \\na long discussion about the wise use of money. After that, I gave him  \\na subscription to the Wall Street Journal and a few books on the  \\nstock market.”\\n“Then what?” I asked. “What was the catch?”\\n“I told him the $3,000 was his, but he could not directly buy a car \\nwith it. He could use it to find a stockbroker and buy and sell stocks. \\nOnce he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the money would be his \\nfor the car, and the $3,000 would go into his college fund.”\\n“And what are the results?” I asked.\\n“Well, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost everything a few \\ndays later. Then he really got interested. Today, I would say he is down \\n$2,000, but his interest is up. He has read all the books I bought him, \\nand he’s gone to the library to get more. He reads the  Wall Street Journal \\nvoraciously, watching for indicators. He’s got only $1,000 left, but his \\ninterest and learning are sky-high. He knows that if he loses that money, \\nhe walks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems \\nuninterested in getting a car, because he’s found a game that is more fun.”\\n“What happens if he loses all the money?” I asked.\\n“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. I’d rather have him lose \\neverything now than wait till he’s our age to risk losing everything. \\nAnd besides, that is the best $3,000 I’ve ever spent on his education. \\nWhat he is learning will serve him for life, and he seems to have gained \\na new respect for the power of money.” \\nAs I said earlier, if a person cannot master the power of self-  \\ndiscipline, it is best not to try to get rich. I say this because, although  \\nthe process of developing cash flow from an asset column is easy in \\ntheory, what’s hard is the mental fortitude to direct money to the  \\ncorrect use. Due to external temptations, it is much easier in today’s \\nconsumer world to simply blow money out the expense column.  \\nWith weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of  \\nleast resistance. That is the cause of poverty and financial struggle.\\nThe following example illustrates the financial intelligence needed \\nto direct money to make more money.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 176}),\n",

When he was short of money, he gave money to his church \\nor to his favorite charity.\\nIf I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever \\nyou feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and \\nit will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, or \\nfriendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do,  \\nbut it has always worked for me. I trust that the principle of reciprocity \\nis true, and I give what I want. I want money, so I give money, and  \\nit comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help someone else sell  \\nsomething, and sales come to me. I want contacts, and I help \\nsomeone else get contacts. Like magic, contacts come to me. I heard \\na saying years ago that went: “God does not need to receive, but \\nhumans need to give.”\\nMy rich dad would often say, “Poor people are more greedy than \\nrich people.” He would explain that if a person was rich, that person  \\nwas providing something that other people wanted. In my life, \\nwhenever I have felt needy or short of money or short of help, I simply \\nwent out or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it \\nfirst. And when I gave, it always came back. \\nIt reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his \\narms on a cold, freezing night.

I would have \\ncountered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that’s how the game \\nworks. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It’s fun \\nand only a game. Make offers. Someone might say yes.\\nI always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an \\noffer with language that details “subject-to” contingencies, such as the \\napproval of a business partner.  Never specify who the business  \\npartner is.

       " Document(page_content='173\\nFINAL THOUGHTSI would like to share some final thoughts with you.\\nThe main reason I wrote this book, and the reason it has remained \\na bestseller since 2000, was to share insights into how increased financial \\nintelligence can be used to solve many of life’s common problems. Without \\nfinancial training, we all too often use the standard formulas to get through \\nlife: Work hard, save, borrow, and pay excessive taxes. Today, more than  \\never, we need better information.\\nI use the following story as an example of a financial problem that  \\nconfronts many young families today. How do you afford a good  \\neducation for your children and provide for your own retirement?  \\nIt requires using financial intelligence instead of hard work.\\nA friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to  \\nsave money for his four children’s college educations. He was putting \\n$300 away in a college fund each month and had so far accumulated \\nonly about $12,000. He had about 12 more years to save for college \\nsince his oldest child was then six years old.\\nAt the time, the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People \\nwere giving houses away. I suggested to my friend that he buy a house \\nwith some of the money in his college fund. The idea intrigued him, \\nand we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern was that \\nhe did not have credit with the bank to buy another house since he \\nwas so over-extended. I assured him that there were other ways to \\nfinance a property rather than through the bank.\\nWe looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all our \\ncriteria. There were plenty to choose from so shopping was fun. Finally, \\nwe found a three-bedroom, two-bath home in a prime neighborhood. \\nThe owner had been downsized and needed to sell that day because he ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 187}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence174\\nand his family were moving to California where another job waited. \\nThe owner wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took \\nit immediately and agreed to carry back the loan with a 10 percent \\ndown payment. All my friend had to come up with was $7,900. As \\nsoon as the owner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all \\nexpenses were paid, including the mortgage, he put about $125 in his \\npocket each month.\\nHis plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage \\nget paid down faster by applying the extra $125 to the principal each \\nmonth. We figured that in 12 years, a large portion of the mortgage \\nwould be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by \\nthe time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it \\nhad appreciated in value.\\nThree years later, the real estate market greatly improved in \\nPhoenix and he was offered $156,000 for the same house by the \\ntenant who lived in it. Again, he asked me what I thought. I advised \\nthat he sell it, using a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.\\nSuddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another \\nfriend in Austin, Texas, who then moved this tax-deferred capital gain \\ninto a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began receiving \\nchecks for a little less than a $1,000 a month which he then poured \\nback into the college fund. \\nA couple of years later, the mini-warehouse sold, and he received \\na check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale. He rolled those \\nfunds into a new project that would now generate over $3,000 a \\nmonth in income, again, going into the college fund. He is now very \\nconfident that his goal will be met easily. \\nIt only took $7,900 to start and a little financial intelligence. His \\nchildren will be able to afford the education they want, and he will \\nthen use the underlying asset, wrapped in his legal entity, to pay for his \\nretirement. As a result of this successful investment strategy, he will be \\nable to retire early.\\nThank you for reading this book. I hope it has provided some \\ninsights into utilizing the power of money to work for you. Today, we ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 188}),\n",

The idea that “it takes \\nmoney to make money” is the thinking of financially unsophisticated \\npeople. It does not mean that they’re not intelligent. They have simply not \\nlearned the science of money making money.\\nMoney is only an idea. If you want more money, simply change \\nyour thinking. Every self-made person started small with an idea, and \\nthen turned it into something big. The same applies to investing. It \\ntakes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big. I meet \\nso many people who spend their lives chasing the big deal, or trying to \\namass a lot of money to get into a big deal, but to me that is foolish. Too \\noften I have seen unsophisticated investors put their large nest egg into \\none deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good workers, \\nbut they were not good investors.\\nEducation and wisdom about money are important. Start early.  \\nBuy a book. Go to a seminar. Practice. Start small. I turned $5,000 cash \\ninto a one-million-dollar asset producing $5,000 a month cash flow in \\nless than six years. But I started learning as a kid.

       " Document(page_content='Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence176\\nWhen my poor dad said to me, “Go to school, get good grades, \\nand find a safe secure job,” he was recommending I work for earned \\nincome. When my rich dad said, “The rich don’t work for money. \\nThey have their money work for them,” he was talking about passive \\nincome and portfolio income. Passive income, in most cases, is income \\nderived from real estate investments. Portfolio income is income \\nderived from paper assets such as stocks and bonds. Portfolio income \\nis the income that makes Bill Gates the richest man in the world, not \\nearned income.\\nRich dad used to say, “The key to becoming wealthy is the \\nability to convert earned income into passive income or portfolio \\nincome as quickly as possible.” He would say, “Taxes are highest on \\nearned income. The least-taxed income is passive income. That is \\nanother reason why you want your money working hard for you. The \\ngovernment taxes the income you work hard for more than the income \\nyour money works hard for.”\\nIn my second book, Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant,  I explain \\nthe four different types of people who make up the world of business. \\nThey are E (Employee), S (Self-employed), B (Business Owner), and  \\nI (Investor). Most people go to school to learn to be an E or an S. The \\nCASHFLOW Quadrant  is written about the core differences of these \\nfour types and how people can change their quadrant. In fact, most  \\nof our products are created for people in the B and I quadrants.\\nIn Rich Dad’s Guide to Investing, book number three in the Rich \\nDad series, I go into more detail on the importance of converting \\nearned income into passive and portfolio income. Rich dad used to  \\nsay, “All a real investor does is convert earned income into passive  \\nand portfolio income. If you know what you’re doing, investing is not \\nrisky. It’s just common sense.”\\nThe Key to Financial Freedom\\nThe key to financial freedom and great wealth is a person’s ability to \\nconvert earned income into passive and/or portfolio income.

Today we own a real \\nestate investment company for passive income and participate in private \\nplacements and initial public offerings of stock for portfolio income.\\nWe also went back to work to build a financial-education company \\nso that we can continue to create and publish books and games. All of \\nour educational products are created to teach the same skills my rich \\ndad taught me, the skills of converting earned income into passive and \\nportfolio income.\\nThe games we create are important because they teach what books \\ncannot teach. For example, you could never learn to ride a bicycle by \\nonly reading a book. Our CASHFLOW  games for adults and  \\nCASHFLOW for Kids  game are designed to teach players the basic \\ninvestment skills of converting earned income into passive and  \\nportfolio income. They also teach the principles of accounting and \\nfinancial literacy. These games are the only educational products in  \\nthe world that teach people all of \\nthese skills simultaneously.\\nCASHFLOW 202  is the advanced \\nversion of CASHFLOW 101  and \\nrequires the game board from 101, as \\nwell as a full understanding of 101, \\nbefore it can be played. CASHFLOW \\n101 and CASHFLOW for Kids \\nteach the principles of fundamental \\ninvesting. CASHFLOW 202  teaches the \\nprinciples of technical investing. Technical investing involves advanced \\ntrading techniques such as short selling, call options, put options, and \\nstraddles. A person who understands these advanced techniques is able \\nto make money when the market goes up, as well as when the market \\ncomes down. As my rich dad would say, “A real investor makes money \\nin an up market and a down market. That is why they make so much \\nmoney.” One of the reasons they make more money is simply because \\nthey have more self-confidence.

The average investor does not know how to protect \\nthemselves from losses, and that is what CASHFLOW  202 teaches.\\nAverage investors think investing is risky because they have not  \\nbeen formally trained to be professional investors. As Warren Buffett, \\nAmerica’s richest investor says, “Risk comes from not knowing what \\nyou’re doing.” My board games teach the simple basics of fundamental \\ninvesting and technical investing while people are having fun.\\nI occasionally hear someone say, “Your educational games are \\nexpensive,” which poses the question of ROI, the return on investment, \\nor the value returned for the price paid. I nod my head and reply, “Yes, \\nthey may be expensive, especially when compared to entertainment board \\ngames. But my games are not as expensive as a college education, working \\nhard all your life for earned income, paying excessive taxes, and then \\nliving in terror of losing all of your money in the investment markets.”\\nWhen someone walks away mumbling about the price, I can hear  \\nmy rich dad saying, “If you want to be rich, you must know what kind  \\nof income to work hard for, how to keep it, and how to protect it from \\nloss. That is the key to great wealth.” Rich dad would also say, “If you  \\ndo not understand the differences in those three incomes and do not \\nlearn the skills on how to acquire and protect those incomes, you will \\nprobably spend your life earning less than you could and working harder \\nthan you should.”\\nMy poor dad thought a good education, a good job, and years of \\nhard work were all you needed to be successful. My rich dad also thought \\na good education was important. But to him it was also important \\nthat Mike and I know the differences in the three incomes and what \\nkind of income to work hard for. To him, that was basic financial \\neducation. Knowing the differences in the three incomes and learning \\nthe investment skills of how to acquire the different incomes is basic \\neducation for anyone who strives to acquire great wealth and achieve \\nfinancial freedom—a special kind of freedom that only a few will ever \\nknow.

       " Document(page_content='Editor’s Note\\nThe Times They Are A-Changin’\\nThere have been many changes in our economy and the investing \\nlandscape since Rich Dad Poor Dad  was first published in 1997. Fourteen \\nyears ago, Robert Kiyosaki challenged conventional wisdom with his \\nbold statement that “your house is not an asset.” His contrarian views on \\nmoney and investing were met with skepticism, criticism, and outrage.\\nIn 2002, Robert’s book, Rich Dad’s Prophecy,  advised that we prepare for \\nan upcoming financial market crash. In 2006, Robert joined forces with \\nDonald T rump to write Why We Want You To Be Rich,  a book inspired by \\ntheir concern for the shrinking middle class in America. \\nRobert continues to be a passionate advocate for the importance and \\npower of financial education. Today, in the wake of the subprime fiasco, \\nrecord home foreclosures, and a global economic meltdown that is \\nstill raging, his words seem not only prophetic, but enlightened. Many \\nskeptics have become believers. \\nIn preparing the 2011 edition of Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant,  \\nRobert realized two things: that his message and teachings have withstood \\nthe test of time, and that the investment landscape, the world in which \\ninvestors operate, has changed dramatically. These changes have affected, \\nand will continue to affect, those in the I (Investor) quadrant and have \\nfueled Robert’s decision to update an important section in this book—\\nChapter Five: The Five Levels of Investors.\\nix', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 209}),\n",

If it \\nsounded exciting and glamorous, I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a \\nmarine biologist, an astronaut, a Marine, a ship’s officer, a pilot, and  \\na professional football player. \\nI was fortunate enough to achieve three of those goals: a Marine \\nCorps officer, a ship’s officer, and a pilot.\\nI knew I did not want to become a teacher, a writer, or an accountant.  \\nI did not want to be a teacher because I did not like school. I did not want \\nto be a writer because I failed English twice. And I dropped out of my \\nMBA program because I could not stand accounting.\\nIronically, now that I have grown up, I have become everything  \\nI never wanted to become. Although I disliked school, today I own an \\neducation company. I personally teach around the world because I love \\nteaching. Although I failed English twice because I could not write, \\ntoday I am best known as an author. My book, Rich Dad Poor Dad,  was \\non the New York Times best-sellers list for over seven years and is one of \\nthe top three best-selling books in the United States. The only books \\nahead of it are The Joy of Sex  and The Road Less Traveled.  Adding one \\nmore irony, Rich Dad Poor Dad  and my CASHFLOW®  board game are \\na book and a game about accounting, another subject I struggled with.\\nSo what does this have to do with the question: “What is your goal \\nin life?”Preface\\nWHAT IS YOUR\\nLIFE'S GOAL?\\nxv\", metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 213}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by \\na Vietnamese monk, Thich Naht Hahn: “The path is the goal.” In \\nother words, finding your path in life is your goal in life. Your path is \\nnot your profession, how much money you make, your title, or your \\nsuccesses and failures. \\nFinding your path means finding out what you were put here on \\nthis earth to do. What is your life’s purpose?  Why were you given this \\ngift called life? And what is the gift you give back to life?\\nLooking back, I know going to school was not about finding my \\nlife’s path. I spent four years in military school, studying and training \\nto be a ship’s officer. If I had made a career sailing for Standard Oil \\non their oil tankers, I would never have found my life’s path. If I had \\nstayed in the Marines or had gone to fly for the airlines, I would never \\nhave found my life’s path. \\nHad I continued on as a ship’s officer or become an airline pilot, \\nI would never have become an international best-selling author, \\nbeen a guest on the Oprah  show, written a book with Donald \\nT rump, or started an international education company that teaches \\nentrepreneurship and investing throughout the world. \\nFinding Your Path\\nThis CASHFLOW  Quadrant  book is important because it is about \\nfinding your path in life. As you know, most people are programmed \\nearly in life to “Go to school and get a job.” School is about finding a \\njob in the E or S quadrant. It is not about finding your life’s path.\\nI realize there are people who know exactly what they are going to \\ndo early in life. They grow up knowing they are going to be a doctor, \\nlawyer, musician, golfer or actor. We have all heard about child \\nprodigies, kids with exceptional talents. Yet you may notice, these are \\nprofessions, not necessarily a life’s path. Preface\\nxvi', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 214}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='So How Does One Find Their Path in Life?\\nMy answer is: I wish I knew. If I could wave my magic wand and \\nyour life’s path would magically appear, I would.\\nSince I do not have a magic wand nor can I tell you what to do, \\nthe best thing I can do is tell you what I did. And what I did was trust \\nmy intuition, my heart, and my guts. For example, in 1973, returning \\nfrom the war, when my poor dad suggested I go back to school, get my \\nhigher degrees, and work for the government, my brain went numb, \\nmy heart went heavy and my gut said, “No way.”  \\nWhen he suggested I get my old job back with Standard Oil or fly \\nfor the airlines, again my mind, heart, and gut said no. I knew I was \\nthrough sailing and flying, although they were great professions and \\nthe pay was pretty good. \\nIn 1973 at the age of 26, I was growing up. I had followed my \\nparent’s advice and gone to school, received my college degree, and had \\ntwo professions: a license to be a ship’s officer and a license to fly. The \\nproblem was, they were professions and the dreams of a child.\\nAt the age of 26, I was old enough to know that education is a process. \\nFor example, when I wanted to be a ship’s officer, I went to a school that \\nturned out ships’ officers. And when I wanted to learn to fly, I went to \\nNavy flight school, a two-year process that turns non-pilots into pilots.  \\nI was cautious about my next educational process. I wanted to know what \\nI was going to become before I started my next educational process.\\nT raditional schools had been good to me. I had achieved my \\nchildhood professions. Reaching adulthood was confusing because \\nthere were no signs saying, “This is the way.” I knew what I didn’t  want \\nto do, but I did not know what I wanted  to do.\\nIt would have been simple if all I wanted was a new profession.  \\nIf I had wanted to be a medical doctor, I would have gone to medical \\nschool. If I had wanted to be a lawyer, I would have gone to law \\nschool. But I knew there was more to life than just going to school to \\ngain another professional credential. \\nI did not realize it at the time, but at 26 years of age, I was now \\nlooking for my path in life, not my next profession.CASHFLOW Quadrant\\nxvii', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 215}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A Different Education\\nIn 1973, in my last year of active duty flying for the Marine \\nCorps when I was stationed near home in Hawaii, I knew I wanted \\nto follow in my rich dad’s footsteps. While in the Marines, I signed \\nup for real estate courses and business courses on the weekends, \\npreparing to become an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants. \\nAt the same time, upon a friend’s recommendation of a friend, \\nI signed up for a personal-development course, hoping to find out \\nwho I really was. A personal-development course is non-traditional \\neducation because I was not taking it for credits or grades. I did not \\nknow what I was going to learn, as I did when I signed up for real \\nestate courses. All I knew was that it was time to take courses to find \\nout about me.\\nIn my first weekend course, the instructor drew this simple \\ndiagram on the flip chart:\\nSPIRITUALEMOTIONALMENTALPHYSICALPreface\\nxviii', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 216}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='With the diagram complete, the instructor turned and said, \\n“To develop into a whole human being, we need mental, physical, \\nemotional, and spiritual education.”\\nListening to her explanation, it was clear to me that traditional schools \\nwere primarily about developing students mentally. That is why so many \\nstudents who do well in school, do not do well in real life, especially in the \\nworld of money.\\nAs the course progressed over the weekend, I discovered why I disliked \\nschool. I realized that I loved learning, but hated school.\\nT raditional education was a great environment for the “A” \\nstudents, but it was not the environment for me. T raditional education \\nwas crushing my spirit, trying to motivate me with the emotion of \\nfear: the fear of making mistakes, the fear of failing, and the fear of not \\ngetting a job. They were programming me to be an employee in the E \\nor S quadrant. I realized that traditional education is not the place for \\na person who wants to be an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants.\\nThis may be why so many entrepreneurs never finish school—\\nentrepreneurs like Thomas Edison, founder of General Electric; Henry \\nFord, founder of Ford Motor Company; Steve Jobs, founder of Apple; \\nBill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Walt Disney, founder of Disneyland; \\nand Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.\\nAs the day went on and the instructor went deeper and deeper into \\nthese four types of personal development, I realized I had spent most \\nof my life in very harsh educational environments. After four years at \\nan all-male military academy and five years as a Marine pilot, I was \\npretty strong mentally and physically. As a Marine pilot, I was strong \\nemotionally and spiritually, but all on the macho-male development \\nside. I had no gentle side, no female energy. After all, I was trained to \\nbe Marine Corps officer, emotionally calm under pressure, prepared to \\nkill, and spiritually prepared to die for my country.\\nIf you ever saw the movie Top Gun  starring Tom Cruise, you get \\na glimpse into the masculine world and bravado of military pilots.

The seminar had been a gentle, loving, honest environment. \\nMonday morning was a shock to once again be surrounded by young \\negotistical pilots, dedicated to flying, killing and dying for country.\\nAfter that weekend seminar, I knew it was time to change. I knew \\ndeveloping myself emotionally and spiritually to become a kinder, \\ngentler, and more compassionate person would be the hardest thing \\nI could do. It went against all my years at the military academy and \\nflight school.\\nI never returned to traditional education again. I had no desire \\nto study for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From \\nthen on, if I did attend a course or school, I went to learn, to become \\na better person. I was no longer in the paper chase of grades, degrees, \\nand credentials. \\nGrowing up in a family of teachers, your grades, the high school \\nand college you graduated from, and your advanced degrees were \\neverything.

       " Document(page_content='Finding My Path\\nI know some of you are now asking: Why is he spending so much \\ntime talking about non-traditional education courses?\\nThe reason is, that first personal-development seminar rekindled \\nmy love of learning, but not the type of learning that is taught in \\nschool. Once that seminar was over, I became a seminar junkie, going \\nfrom seminar to seminar, finding out more about the connection \\nbetween my body, my mind, my emotions, and my spirit.\\nThe more I studied, the more curious about traditional education  \\nI became.

       " Document(page_content='Why Is a Path Important?\\nWe all know people who make a lot of money, but hate their \\nwork. We also know people who do not make a lot of money and \\nhate their work. And we all know people who just work for money.\\nA classmate of mine from the Merchant Marine Academy also \\nrealized he did not want to spend his life at sea. Rather than sail for \\nthe rest of his life, he went to law school after graduation, spending \\nthree more years becoming a lawyer and entering private practice in \\nthe S quadrant. \\nHe died in his early fifties. He had become a very successful, \\nunhappy lawyer. Like me, he had two professions by the time he was \\n26. Although he hated being a lawyer, he continued being a lawyer \\nbecause he had a family, kids, a mortgage, and bills to pay. \\nA year before he died, I met him at a class reunion in New York. \\nHe was a bitter man. “All I do is sweep up behind rich guys like you. \\nThey pay me nothing. I hate what I do and who I work for.”\\n“Why don’t you do something else?” I asked.\\n“I can’t afford to stop working. My first child is entering college.”\\nHe died of a heart attack before she graduated. \\nHe made a lot of money via his professional training, but he was \\nemotionally angry, spiritually dead, and soon his body followed.\\nI realize this is an extreme example. Most people do not hate what \\nthey do as much as my friend did. Yet it illustrates the problem when \\na person is trapped in a profession and unable to find their path. \\nTo me, this is the shortcoming of traditional education. Millions \\nof people leave school, only to be trapped in jobs they do not like. \\nThey know something is missing in life. Many people are also trapped \\nfinancially, earning just enough to survive, wanting to earn more but \\nnot knowing what to do.\\nWithout awareness of the other quadrants, many people go back \\nto school and look for new professions or pay raises in the E or S \\nquadrant, unaware of the world of the B and I quadrants.Preface\\nxxii', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 220}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='My Reason for Becoming a T eacher\\nMy primary reason for becoming a teacher in the B quadrant was a \\ndesire to provide financial education. I wanted to make this education \\navailable to anyone who wanted to learn, regardless of how much money \\nthey had or what their grade-point averages were. That is why The Rich \\nDad Company started with the CASHFLOW  game. This game can teach \\nin places I could never go. The beauty of the game is that it was designed \\nto have people teach people. There is no need for an expensive teacher \\nor classroom. The CASHFLOW  game is now translated into over sixteen \\nlanguages, reaching millions of people all over the world.\\nToday, The Rich Dad Company offers financial-education courses as \\nwell as the services of coaches and mentors to support a person’s financial \\neducation. Our programs are especially important for anyone wanting to \\nevolve out of the E and S quadrants into the B and I quadrants.\\nThere is no guarantee that everyone will make it to the B and I \\nquadrants, yet they will know how to access those quadrants if they want to.\\nChange Is Not Easy\\nFor me, changing quadrants was not easy. It was hard work \\nmentally, but more so emotionally and spiritually. Growing up in a \\nfamily of highly educated employees in the E quadrant, I carried their \\nvalues of education, job security, benefits, and a government pension. \\nIn many ways, my family values made my transition difficult. I had to \\nshut out their warnings, concerns, and criticisms about becoming an \\nentrepreneur and investor. Some of their values I had to discount were:\\n•\\t“But you have to have a job.”\\n•\\t“You’re taking too many risks.”\\n•\\t“What if you fail?”\\n•\\t“Just go back to school and get your masters degree.”\\n•\\t“Become a doctor.

Don’t go for your dreams.”\\nDiet and Exercise\\nI mention emotional and spiritual development because that is \\nwhat it takes to make a permanent change in life. For example, it \\nrarely works to tell an overweight person, “Just eat less and exercise \\nmore.” Diet and exercise may make sense mentally, but most people \\nwho are overweight do not eat because they are hungry. They eat to \\nfeed an emptiness in their emotions and their soul. When a person \\ngoes on a diet-and-exercise program, they are only working on their \\nmind and their body. Without emotional development and spiritual \\nstrength, the overweight person may go on a diet for six months  \\nand lose a ton of weight, only to put even more weight back on later.\\nThe same is true for changing quadrants. Saying to yourself,  \\n“I’m going to become an entrepreneur in the B quadrant,” is as futile \\nas a chain smoker saying, “Tomorrow I’m going to quit smoking.” \\nSmoking is a physical addiction caused by emotional and spiritual \\nchallenges. Without emotional and spiritual support, the smoker  \\nwill always be a smoker. The same is true for an alcoholic, a sex \\naddict, or a chronic shopper. Most addictions are attempts to find \\nhappiness in people’s souls.\\nThis is why my company offers courses for the mind and body, \\nbut also coaches and mentors to support the emotional and spiritual \\ntransitions.\\nA few people are able to make the journey alone, but I was not \\none of them.

       " Document(page_content='“Once upon a time there was this quaint little village. It was a great \\nplace to live except for one problem. The village had no water unless it \\nrained. To solve this problem once and for all, the village elders asked \\ncontractors to submit bids to deliver water to the village on a daily basis. \\nT wo people volunteered to take on the task, and the elders awarded the \\ncontract to both of them. They felt that a little competition would keep \\nprices low and ensure a backup supply of water.\\n“The first person who won the contract, Ed, immediately ran out, \\nbought two galvanized steel buckets and began running back and forth \\nto the lake which was a mile away. He immediately began making \\nmoney as he labored morning to dusk, hauling water from the lake with \\nhis two buckets. He would empty them into the large concrete holding \\ntank the village had built. Each morning he had to get up before the rest \\nof the village awoke to make sure there was enough water for the people. \\nIt was hard work, but he was very happy to be making money and for \\nhaving one of the two exclusive contracts for this business.\\n“The second winning contractor, Bill, disappeared for a while.  \\nHe wasn’t seen for months, which made Ed very happy, since he had \\nno competition. \\n“Instead of buying two buckets to compete with Ed, Bill wrote a \\nbusiness plan, created a corporation, found four investors, employed \\na president to do the work, and returned six months later with a \\nconstruction crew. Within a year, his team had built a large-volume \\nstainless-steel pipeline which connected the village to the lake.\\n“At the grand-opening celebration, Bill announced that his  \\nwater was cleaner than Ed’s water. Bill knew that the villagers had \\ncomplained about the water’s lack of cleanliness. Bill also announced \\nthat he could supply the village with water 24 hours a day, 7 days a \\nweek. Ed could only deliver water on weekdays because he didn’t want  \\nto work on weekends. Then Bill announced that he would charge  \\n75 percent less than Ed did for this higher-quality, more-reliable water. \\nThe villagers cheered and immediately ran for the faucet at the end  \\nof Bill’s pipeline.\\n5CASHFLOW Quadrant', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Rich Dad Poor Dad ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'page': 231}),\n",

In order to provide better \\nservice, he hired his two sons to give him a hand on the night shift \\nand on weekends. When his boys went off to college, he said to them, \\n‘Hurry back because someday this business will belong to you.’\\n“For some reason, his two sons never returned. Eventually, Ed had \\nemployees and union problems. The union demanded higher wages \\nand better benefits and wanted its members to only haul one bucket \\nat a time.\\n“Meanwhile, Bill realized that if this village needed water, then \\nother villages must need water too. He rewrote his business plan and \\nwent off to sell his high-speed, high-volume, low-cost, clean-water \\ndelivery system to villages throughout the world. He only makes a \\npenny per bucket of water delivered, but he delivers billions of  \\nbuckets of water every day.
